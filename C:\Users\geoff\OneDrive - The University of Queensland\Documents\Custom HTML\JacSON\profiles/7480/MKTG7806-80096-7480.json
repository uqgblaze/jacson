If there are disagreements in relation to team members' contributions that cannot be resolved, students must bring the problem to the attention of their Course Coordinator as early as possible. Students can elect to undertake a Peer Review process, which can influence the marks of those who do not contribute to group work.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
