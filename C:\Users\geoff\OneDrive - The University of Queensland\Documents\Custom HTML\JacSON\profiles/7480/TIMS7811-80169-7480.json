            "task_description": "This is a team assignment. You will be assigned to teams of 3-5 people. The task for this assignment is to create an image-based essaydescribing an innovation. It will consist primarilly of images (e.g. photos; graphs etc) presented to the class on the due date. You will have to upload yourpresentation to Blackboard before commencement of class. The photo essay should be structured as follows:Part 1:Select an innovation that a random person on the street would not be aware of (e.g. don't tell us about your iPhone!). Draw on course concepts todescribe the type of innovation, what makes it innovative, and how and why it was developed.Part 2:Identify and illustrate the \"enabling technologies\" that needed to be in place for this innovation to be created and successfully diffuse.Part 3:Drawing on cause concepts to identify the \"winners\" and \"loosers\" associated with this innovation's diffusion.Part 4:Drawing on course concepts, identify what you believe was the single most important innovation leadership challenge associated with thisinnovation's development and diffusion.Ideally, I would like you to take as many of the photos as possible yourself. One of the points of this assignment is to make some of these ideas aboutinnovations more tangible, and figuring out how to take a good picture of something that is not a product is a good way to do this. However, if you cannottake original pictures, you can source (or generate) images from other sources. You can also do this for things that are just impossible to photograph. I'mnot too worried about the quality of the photos, as long as I can tell what they are and how they fit into your story.Please also note that not all students have to present but ALL students must contribute to compiling the presentation and be present to answer questionsfrom the panel.Peer Evaluation: BuddyCheckevaluation has to be submitted individually by ALL team members as part of your team assessment.AI STATEMENTThis assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
