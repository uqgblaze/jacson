This group exercise will be conducted using a stakeholder simulation program involving a complex business issue of social, cultural and/or ethical nature.Students will work together as an executive team, applying course frameworks, tools, and models to address the business simulation objective/challenge. The lecturer will set-up and run the simulation, as well as monitor group progress and facilitate debrief sessions after each phase of the business simulation. The simulation provides an overall performance score for each group. The students are then asked to submit a 1-page individual reflection by the due date on the challenges of stakeholder management, guiding questions will be provided.AI STATEMENTThis assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
