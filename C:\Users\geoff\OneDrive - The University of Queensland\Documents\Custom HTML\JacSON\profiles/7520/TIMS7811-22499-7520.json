            "task_description": "OverviewThis team-based assignment challenges you to explore less conventional forms of innovation—not products or services—and examine their broader impacts. Your team will create a photo essay that visually and analytically presents an innovation, identifying its enablers, beneficiaries, and potential disruptions. The aim is to provoke deeper thinking about innovation’s complexity, its ripple effects across industries, and its influence on society. Consider looking for examples close to home—perhaps from your own professional backgrounds or industries your team is familiar with.Assignment StructurePart 1: Identifying and Showcasing an InnovationChoose an innovation that is not a product or service but represents a new way of doing things (e.g. innovations in policy, infrastructure, societal systems, cultural practices, or production processes). Take or source a photo that visually represents the innovation.In your presentation, describe:What the innovation is.What makes it innovative.Why it is significant, focusing on its business and economic implications rather than purely technological aspects.Part 2: Exploring Its EnablersIdentify 3-5 enablers that made this innovation possible (e.g. supporting infrastructure, economic conditions, cultural factors, policy changes, or enabling technologies). Use photos to illustrate these enablers.Discuss the role of each enabler in supporting the innovation, including any advantages or disadvantages they bring.Part 3: Analysing the BeneficiariesShow 2-4 images depicting those who benefit from this innovation (e.g. individuals, organisations, industries, or communities). Explain how the innovation creates value by:Solving problems ('pain relievers').Creating new opportunities ('gain creators').Considering any negative externalities (e.g. unintended consequences, ethical considerations).Part 4: Evaluating Potential DisruptionsUse 2-4 images to show areas of the economy, industries, or organisations that are disrupted or threatened by this innovation. Analyse the impact of these disruptions, applying relevant theories of innovation and competitive dynamics.Discuss the long-term implications for affected sectors.Presentation RequirementsYour team will present the photo essay in class, with each team member contributing to either the content creation or delivery.Not all members need to present, but all must contribute and be present for Q&A.Your slides must be uploaded to Blackboard before class begins.Tip: Engage your audience! Use clear visuals, storytelling techniques, and compelling analysis to make your presentation impactful.Photo GuidelinesWherever possible, take original photos to strengthen your analysis.If original photos are not feasible, you may use online images, ensuring they are credited appropriately.The quality of the photos is less important than their clarity and relevance to your argument.Peer Review RequirementEach student must submit an individual peer evaluation via Blackboard.Failure to submit a peer review will result in a zero score for both the team presentation and the Innovation Strategy Report.Why Peer Review? This ensures fair contribution across team members and encourages collaborative leadership, accountability, and reflection.Marking Rubric is available on BlackboardAI StatementThis assignment is designed to be challenging, authentic, and complex, requiring critical engagement beyond AI-generated content.You may use AI or MT tools to assist with organising ideas, structuring analysis, or enhancing presentation design.However, all insights and critical thinking must be your own—you must demonstrate independent comprehension in your work.Failure to reference AI use may constitute academic misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Final RemindersChoose a unique, thought-provoking innovation—challenge conventional ideas.Use clear visuals and strong analysis to tell a compelling story.Collaborate effectively—all team members must contribute meaningfully.Submit slides on Blackboard before class—no late submissions accepted.Be ready for Q&A—demonstrate your deep understanding of the innovation.Tip: Need inspiration?

            "task_description": "OverviewThis individual assignment requires you to write a 1,500-word reflective essay based on your experience with the Back Bay Battery online innovation strategy simulation. The objective is to critically analyse the challenges and insights gained from managing innovation transitions and relate them to relevant academic literature and workplace practice.The simulation models the transition from an existing business to a new, innovative model. While this example focuses on a product, its principles apply equally to any business navigating Horizon 2 innovations. Your essay must demonstrate analytical depth, drawing connections between simulation experience, innovation themes, and real-world business applications.Task DescriptionYour reflective essay should address the following key areas:Simulation Experience: Describe your experience with the simulation. What challenges did you encounter? What decisions were particularly difficult, and why?Innovation Themes: How did the simulation reflect key innovation concepts discussed in class? Consider:The Christensen framework on disruptive innovation.The challenges of integrating a Horizon 2 innovation into Horizon 1 (Refer to Moore, Geoffrey A. \"To Succeed in the Long-Term, Focus on the Middle-Term,” Harvard Business Review, 2006).Lessons about managing disruptive innovation.Workplace Reflection: Based on your simulation insights, how can the lessons be applied to managing innovation and technological change in your current or previous workplace?The essay must follow proper academic formatting and use APA referencing style. A descriptive summary will not be sufficient—you will be assessed on your ability to analyse, synthesise, and evaluate experiences against the simulation and relevant literature.Simulation ProcessYou will play introductory and an advanced scenarios of the Back Bay Battery simulation.The advanced scenario will have adjusted settings to encourage deeper understanding of the principles at play.You will have access to the simulation via your Harvard Business account (details provided on Blackboard).Use your experiences in both rounds to develop insights for your reflective essay.Assessment Marking Rubric is available on BlackboardAI StatementThis assignment requires critical reflection and original analysis. While AI or MT tools may assist with structuring or refining ideas, your essay must demonstrate independent critical thinking and synthesis of learning.All AI or MT use must be referenced appropriately. Failure to disclose AI assistance may constitute academic misconduct.Plagiarism or over-reliance on AI-generated content will result in penalties. Your essay should reflect your own interpretation and understanding of the simulation and related concepts.Final RemindersEnsure your essay is analytical, not just descriptive.Use high-quality academic sources in your discussion.Submit on time via Blackboard.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
