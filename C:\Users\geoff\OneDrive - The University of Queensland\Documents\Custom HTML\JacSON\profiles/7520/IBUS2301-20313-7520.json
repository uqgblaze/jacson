Students will pitch their proposals targeted at an identified real 'live' company featured in class - further details on the topics for the two pitches will be provided in seminars and via Blackboard. Students in their teams need to be prepared to insightfully address any question(s) following their pitch.One student from each team must submit their team charter on behalf of their team, so that the team can receive a mark for this assessment.This is a team assessment and it is important that students reflect on the first seminar to ensure effective group dynamics and expectations are promoted and use the tools provided in seminar 2. Teams will be formed for this assessment at the start of semester.Each individual in the group will also need to complete a peer assessment evaluation to accompany this piece of assessment, which will be available in Blackboard. More details will be provided during seminars. All team members will be required to complete peer evaluations using BuddyCheck to ensure equal member contributions.
