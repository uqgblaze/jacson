You should do this by communicating effectively; that is, using concise, fluent and persuasive language, and structuring the presentation in a way that keeps the audience engaged. The final part of the assessment integrates a Q&A segment, when your industry partner will ask you questions and provide feedback. This provides a great opportunity to gather valuable feedback from them, which can be incorporated in the final industry report.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.AI Statement:Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
