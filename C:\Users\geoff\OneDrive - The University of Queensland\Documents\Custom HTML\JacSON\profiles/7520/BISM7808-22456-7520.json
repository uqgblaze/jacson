The innovative information technology should be based on artificial intelligence. In some circumstances, alternative (but still innovative) information technologies may be considered with permission from the lecturer and where the student has a special interest.The analysis considers the implications of the information technology in terms of the challenges and opportunities the technology presents, and the implications for the organisation’s ‘future readiness’ for digital transformation. This analysis should also address the organisation's wider social context in terms of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and its ethical, legal and social responsibilities.You are to prepare a short briefing paper appropriate for presentation to the organisation's Board of Directors that make appropriate and well-reasoned recommendations. The recommendations aim to make the organisation more 'future ready' than it currently is.  The enterprise may be any existing real-world enterprise. In practice, this might be the student's past or current employer, or perhaps a prospective future employer.  The briefing presents specific and focussed recommendations (between 4 and 6 recommendations) that are actionable by the Board. At least two recommendations are to consider the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the organisation's ethical, legal, and social responsibilities.The analysis should draw on analytical techniques discussed in seminars.Key to success in this assessment that the Executive Briefing be clear and concise, and appropriate for its audience.AI StatementThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of this assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

This presentation is followed by an interactive question-and-answer session probing the group’s recommendations and their implications.Students are allocated by the lecturer to teams of 3-5 students, and are to present a strategic direction forward for the organisation to the class that addresses challenges and issues apparent in the case. Prospective cases are identified in class and through Learn.UQ, and cases are allocated to groups according to preferences where possible.This assessment has three aspects.The team should present and summarise the key challenges and issues identified as arising from the case.The team should present a strategic direction forward for the organisation that makes recommendations regarding IT governance mechanisms and strategy choices to the executive audience indicated by the case. These recommendations are informed by the organisational context of the case as discussed in seminars.After the 15 minute presentation, the team leads a question-and-answer discussion with other students (acting in the role of the Board) for up to 10 minutes.The presentation requires the audience to act and participate as stakeholders of the organisation discussed in the case. All presentation materials are to be submitted by the end of the teaching session in which the presentation is made. As a team project, an individual peer assessment factor is applied to the team mark to calculate each team member's own individual mark to represent each team member's relative contribution to the project outcome.AI StatementThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
