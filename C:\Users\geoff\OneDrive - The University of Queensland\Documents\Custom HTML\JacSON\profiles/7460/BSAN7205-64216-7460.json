Student teams are commissioned by the Brisbane-based analytics firm Aginic to develop this solution for the Edenglassie Department of Education: students are asked to investigate the role of data in transforming the education field and, accordingly, develop a business case and an initial prototype for an analytics solution that could enable teachers and corporate staff to make data-driven decisions that improve students’ learning experience.This assessment is group-based. Students are supported by an online white board that enables asynchronous contributions from each team member.Students will be required to complete a self and peer evaluation as part of this assignment. A series of review questions will be available on BlackBoard and should be completed on submission of your teams manual. The evaluation process assists the teaching team to understand how each student contributed and the findings are confidential. The peer evaluation can affect each student's mark for this assignment. Further details will be provided in class and on Blackboard. This assessment builds student employability by providing an opportunity to access knowledge, think critically, problem solve and work in a team.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

They will need to engage with the Data module and use their knowledge of data exploration and transformation to make the dataset fit-for-use in the process of building their analytics solution. The final dataset needs to meet stakeholder needs and support the prototype proposed in the first assignment.Students are provided with several tables by Aginic pertaining to students’ assessment, attendance, and activities. They will need to explore the dataset and identify as many of the possible data quality issues as you can, then perform transformations to address the issues they have identified. Finally, they also need to justify why your transformed dataset is fit-for-use. This assessment builds your employability by developing your coding and data exploration skills.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

They need to build on the prototype they had proposed for Assessment 1 and use the curated data that was prepared for Assessment 2. The business-analytics solution must respond to the information needs specific to the categories of users represented and must enable users to perform a range of dimensional analyses of data (drilling down, rolling up, etc.).For the delivery of the business analytics solution, students are asked to showcase how their solution can benefit the users too. Therefore, they have to generate insight via the data, engage in storytelling with analytical insights and propose actions, and close by reflecting on the solution’s value. This assessment builds your employability by developing your skills in designing digital platforms as a visual technique to communicate solutions to industry.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
