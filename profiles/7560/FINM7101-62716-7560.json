Students will perform a portfolio optimization task using Python and historical market data.The deliverable includes a detailed report that explains the methodology, findings, and implications of the analysis, as well as a technical appendix containing Python code used in the computations. This task emphasizes critical thinking, fostering a practical understanding of investment portfolio management under real-world conditions.AI Statement:This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
