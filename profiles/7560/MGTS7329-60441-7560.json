Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. This includes dictionary and translation applications (APPs).</p>\n<p>This entire group assignment is worth 40% of your final mark. The assignment consists of multiple parts, all group members must participate in all aspects of the assignment, please consult your assignment guide for details. Not submitting the individual contribution materials will exclude you from receiving the group’s mark, since it implies you made no contribution(s) to the group assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Groups will be randomly created by the course coordinator/facilitator. Team changes deadline is week 3. Once the teams are created you must contact your group by the end of week 3 or risk not having a group and conducting the assignment by yourself<em>, as well as losing out on group marks. </em></strong>48 hours is a reasonable response time, or as agreed in the team charter.</p>\n<p><strong>Each group will be randomly assigned a presentation date. All are in the same situation, so please take note of your presentation time and adjust your schedule accordingly.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Peer Evaluation: </strong> The purpose of this evaluation is to assess a member’s contribution to the group effort. Group members may contribute to the group along various dimensions. These include their organisation/project management, knowledge/research, communication, and responsibility, including supporting the group and members in any way. Use the 9-point rating scale given below to rate yourself and members of your group. Please be as objective as possible, taking behaviours rather than personal style into consideration. <strong>Peer reviews are compulsory to ensure that a contribution score is available for all moderation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> You are required to assess your peers on their contribution to the group assignment by allocating each group member a mark in each of the four criteria. For each criterion, allocate a mark between one and six, where a mark of one <strong>(1) indicates</strong> <strong>no contribution</strong> or submitting contribution passed the agreed group deadline, and a mark of <strong>nine (9) indicates that they made the maximum contribution possible. </strong></p>\n<p>1 = Person demonstrated <strong>no contribution in this criterion</strong> or submitted contributions past the agreed-upon group deadline.</p>\n<p>1.01 – 1.99 = Person demonstrated a low contribution to the group in this criterion.</p>\n<p>2 – 3.99 = Person demonstrated a medium-low contribution to the group in this criterion.</p>\n<p>4 – 5.99 = Person demonstrated a medium-level contribution to the group in this criterion.</p>\n<p>6 – 8.4 = Person consistently demonstrated a medium-high level of contribution to the group in this criterion.</p>\n<p>8.5 - 9 = Person consistently demonstrated high-level contribution to the group in a criterion.</p>\n<p>·        A mark of six (6) or less (1 to 6), based on the above guide (out of 9) for any criteria, requires a comment; otherwise, it is invalid.</p>\n<p>·        To take account of the possibility that a student does not contribute to one or all criteria, 1 signifies that a student has not contributed.</p>\n<p>·        Peer reviews are compulsory and must be submitted within five days of the assessment due date, <em>not submitting peer reviews may decrease marks. </em>If no peer review is received from a student after 5 days, then no contribution scores are calculated and not available for all moderation. No exceptions! </p>\n<p><strong>Important Mark Moderation Based on Peer Review – highest score is 9, see explanation below.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The moderation of individual marks will be based on the following overall average review):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>·        8.5 to 9.0</strong> (consistently demonstrated full contribution to group), <strong>no deduction from group mark.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>·        8.0 to 8.4 </strong>(demonstrated medium-high level contribution)<strong> 5% deduction from group mark.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>·        6.0 to 7.99 </strong>(demonstrated medium level contribution), <strong>15% deduction from group mark.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>·        3.0 to 5.99</strong> (demonstrated medium-low contribution), <strong>25% deduction from group mark.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>·        1.01 to 2.99</strong> (demonstrated low contribution in several criteria or submitted contribution passed agreed group deadline), <strong>50% deduction from group mark</strong>.</p>\n<p>·        <strong>1, no individual mark will be awarded.</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>Criteria 1: Organisation/Project Management</strong></p>\n<p>Allocate a mark between one (1) and six (6) for all criterion to each team member for their role in contributing to the process needed to complete the assignment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider their approach to setting up meeting times and work submission deadlines as well as their willingness to listen to other team members' opinions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Criteria 2: Knowledge/research</strong></p>\n<p>Allocate a mark to each team member for their contribution of research, knowledge, opinions, and skills to team discussions and work completion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintaining academic integrity (ensuring original work; no plagiarised and/or AI-generated materials).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Criteria 3: Communication</strong></p>\n<p>Allocate a mark to each team member for how well they collaborated and communicated with others in the team and fulfilled their roles within the team. To determine your mark consider if each team member:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>was present at all meetings, as long as feasibly possible(either in person or via phone/online) (barring legitimate reasons);</li>\n<li>played an active role in facilitating agreement and resolving conflict and;</li>\n<li>provided timely responses to all communications and queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Criteria 4: Responsibility</strong></p>\n<p>Allocate a mark to each team member for how well they took responsibility for the team’s outcome, and consistently acted in a manner that demonstrated they were keen for the team to perform well (e.g., supporting the team).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This includes ensuring that the English language is used in all forms of communication. Since the official language of Australia is English, non-compliance can lead to assessments awarded the mark of zero, and non-compliance in group/team settings be interpreted as exclusionary behaviour, a form of bullying and a serious offence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Peer reviews are compulsory and must be submitted within 5 calendar days of the assessment due date, <em>not submitting peer reviews may decrease marks. </em>If no peer review is received from a student after 5 calendar days, then is not included for all moderation.
