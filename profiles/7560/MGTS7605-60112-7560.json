The composition of teams will remain constant throughout the semester, promoting stable group dynamics and consistent collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>Quiz Structure and Schedule:</strong> Each week, you will take a quiz based on the course content. The quizzes will be conducted in two modes: individually and then as a team.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weeks 1-2:</strong> Quizzes will be formative (ungraded) and serve as practice to familiarize you with the quiz format and course content.</li>\n<li><strong>Weeks 3-13:</strong> Quizzes will be summative (graded) and will significantly influence your final grade.</li>\n<li>During class each week you will complete an individual quiz. Later in that same class you will complete a team quiz on the same material. The team and individual quizzes will contain identical questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scoring and Grades:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Individual Quizzes:</strong> Your performance in these quizzes will account for 30% of your semester grade.</li>\n<li><strong>Team Quizzes:</strong> These will contribute 20% to your semester grade. The combined score from individual and team quizzes makes up 50% of your final grade.</li>\n<li>It is expected that team quiz scores will generally be higher than individual scores, reflecting effective communication and collaboration within teams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Teamwork and Collaboration:</strong> Success in team quizzes requires not only a thorough understanding of the course content but also effective communication skills. You will need to discuss quiz answers with your team members, apply course concepts in real-time, and convince your peers of the correct answers, mirroring real-world professional scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> In the event of disagreements during team quizzes, groups will need to employ negotiation strategies discussed in the course. Leveraging HR concepts to manage group dynamics effectively is an integral part of the learning process and will enhance your practical understanding of the course material.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

This is a group project where you'll create and submit a pre-recorded video presentation, <strong>not to exceed 15 minutes in duration</strong>. In this presentation, your group will use concepts from the entire course to evaluate and design a performance management system within an organization that aligns fundamental management theory, organizational goals, and ethical principles. You must also evaluate the impact of this performance management system on employee motivation, engagement, and organizational performance. Your designed system should optimize performance management while integrating technology, data analytics, and best practices. You are also encouraged to include any other relevant topics you deem essential to make a persuasive case.</p>\n<p>This task emphasizes collaborative effort and it is crucial that all team members contribute meaningfully to the presentation. Your teamwork on this assessment will contribute 40% to your semester grade, and individual contributions will be separately measured using peer evaluation, accounting for 10% of your semester grade. This presentation is not just about presenting facts; it's about working as a team to effectively communicate a comprehensive and convincing argument.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Clarifications:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Scope and Objective:</strong></p>\n<p>  - The evaluation and design of the Performance Management System is not limited to a specific type of organization; it can be corporate, non-profit, government, etc.</p>\n<p>  - Through analysis of the performance management system, teams should identify which concepts from the course to emphasize, based on the time available for the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Presentation Details:</strong></p>\n<p>*** All team members are required to present in the video. Voice-over only is not permitted.</p>\n<p>- Student teams can determine the best format for their pre-recorded video presentations (e.g., PowerPoint slides, live demonstration, animated video).</p>\n<p>  - The presentation should be entirely focused on a real-life example or case study. It should not be designed on a fictional account of an organization or a completely fictional/made-up performance management system.</p>\n<p>-Teams must seek permission from the instructor for their choice of organization to evaluate in this assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Group Collaboration:</strong></p>\n<p>  - The peer evaluation process will be established by students during the course using course concepts.</p>\n<p>  - Expectations for the \"meaningful contribution\" of each team member will be determined by students during the semester using course concepts.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Evaluation Criteria:</strong></p>\n<p>  - A separate grading rubric will be used to assess the quality of the presentation. Students should refer to this rubric when producing their presentation.</p>\n<p>  - Video presentations should be submitted via Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong> AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
