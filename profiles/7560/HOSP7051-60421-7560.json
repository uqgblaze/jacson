It focuses on assessing their ability to engage effectively with industry professionals, as well as their reflective learning and practical coordination skills within a real-world context. This assessment involves the following components:</p>\n<p><strong>#1 Student-Led Mini-Industry Forum (Group 50%)</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from Week 4, industry experts will be invited by the teaching team to deliver 30–40-minute guest talks each week on specific industry trends, problems, or best practices.</p>\n<p>Prior to the talks, student teams will be responsible for designing the format of the mini-industry forum, including delivering a 12-minute student presentation, chairing the industry talk, preparing relevant questions, and facilitating the topic discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>Student presentations (25%):</strong> Students will be divided into small groups and tasked with identifying and analysing a real-world hotel industry problem or challenge, drawing on their understanding of the hotel operations model taught in week 2. Each group will then present their problem analysis and proposed solutions in a 12-minute class presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Industry forum design, engagement and student questions (25%):</strong> During the industry guest talk, students will be expected to actively listen, take notes, and participate in the subsequent Q&amp;A session. Following industry expert’s presentations, student teams will take the lead in asking questions and engaging in a deeper discussion of the topic.</p>\n<p>Students will be evaluated on their ability to design mini-industry forums, the quality and relevance of the questions they ask, as well as their critical analysis and responses to the industry expert’s answers.</p>\n<p>To support each team, the teaching staff will offer ongoing mentorship and consultation, ensuring that students receive the guidance and resources necessary to succeed. Presentation order will be scheduled during the semester from Week 4 to Week 11, aligning with the chosen topics and availability of industry guest speakers.</p>\n<p>Evaluation criteria and marking sheets will be provided in blackboard.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>#2 Teamwork evaluation &amp; reflection </strong>(to modify the team performance)</p>\n<p>Teamwork evaluation and reflection will be assessed. All team members must complete a ‘peer evaluation’ for each of their team members and submit online in your Blackboard site through the platform Buddycheck. The purpose of this evaluation and reflection process is to provide an opportunity to learn about how each student contributed to the group project. Collaborative skills are a basic graduate attribute that all students should enter the workplace with. The assessment criteria for collaborative skills are:</p>\n<p>1. <strong><em>Contribution </em></strong>– team member contributed to the process required to complete the assignment.</p>\n<p>2. <strong><em>Knowledge </em></strong>– team member contributed knowledge, opinions, and skills to team discussions and work completion.</p>\n<p>3. <strong><em>Collaboration &amp; Communication </em></strong>– team member collaborated and communicated with others in the team and fulfilled their individual roles within the team.</p>\n<p>4. <strong><em>Responsibility </em></strong>– team member accepted responsibility for the team’s assignment outcome.</p>\n<p>There are several purposes for completing it:</p>\n<p>·        To evaluate a student’s ability to critically evaluate others</p>\n<p>·        To determine if each group member participated equally</p>\n<p>·        To evaluate project-team practices and effectiveness which occurs in project management in the real world</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</em></p>\n<p><em>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</em></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

Students will complete three reflective essays (15% each) and deliver a brief oral presentation (5%). The essays integrate personal experiences, theoretical frameworks, and insights from weekly industry forums and team projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 1: Three Reflective Essays (45%)</strong></p>\n<p>Students will submit three reflective essays, each addressing a different hospitality operations challenge, at the following intervals: Weeks 4-6, Weeks 7-9, and Weeks 10-13. Each essay should be no more than two pages in length.</p>\n<p>Essay Structure: Each essay should include the following sections:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Problem Definition and Personal Context (approx. 150 words): </strong>Clearly <strong>articulate a specific hospitality operations challenge</strong>. Ground your analysis in relevant course lectures and industry forum discussions. Integrate a personal experience (as a guest, employee, or through a hypothetical scenario) to illustrate the problem and provide context for your reflection. <strong>Explain the significance</strong> of this challenge within the broader context of effective hotel management.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Theoretical Framework and Analysis (approx. 150 words):</strong> Introduce a relevant theoretical framework from any discipline (e.g., management, marketing, psychology, sociology, economics) that you believe illuminates the chosen hotel operations issue. Apply this framework to analyze the chosen challenge, integrating insights from the industry forum. Explain how the theory illuminates the problem, highlighting relevant concepts and justifying your choice of framework. Don't just summarize the theory; show how its core principles can be applied to the hospitality context. Critically analyze any discrepancies between theory and practice. Consider different perspectives or interpretations.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Proposed Solutions and Reflective Narrative (approx. 150 words):</strong> Based on your analysis, propose practical solutions or improvements to address the identified challenge. Integrate insights from the industry forum and relate your proposed solutions to your personal experience and the theoretical framework. How might your personal experiences inform the implementation of these solutions? Discuss the potential challenges and limitations of your proposed solutions, demonstrating critical thinking.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Personal Learning and Future Applications (approx. 150 words):</strong> Summarize your key learning outcomes from this reflection. Discuss how your understanding of the challenge has evolved, any new perspectives gained, and unanswered questions. Explain how you will apply this learning to future coursework or your career aspirations.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: In-class Oral Reflection (5%)</strong></p>\n<p>Students will deliver a two-minute oral presentation summarizing their key learning from the essays. This can be presented either after essay submission or during the final week seminar. This oral reflection should be concise, engaging, and reflective of your personal learning experience throughout the course. Further discussion regarding the presentation order will be provided in class.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The presentation should include:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Key Insights (approx. 1 minute):</strong> Summarize the main theoretical insights and practical solutions explored in your essays. Reflect on how industry forum and seminar discussions shaped your understanding.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Personal Learning (approx. 1 minute): </strong>Share your personal learning journey. Discuss how your understanding of hospitality operations has evolved and how you plan to apply this knowledge in your future career.</p>\n<p>Students presenting before the final week are encouraged to present again during the final seminar. The higher mark from the two presentations will be used for assessment.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>AI statement:</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
