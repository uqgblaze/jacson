Note that in this Service Operations Management course we cover a wide range of concepts that students can use to map service operations and service processes. We have also cover concepts that can be applied to for instance identify and reduce waste, improve service quality, improve service process design etc and students should select andapply the most relevant course theory conceptsto assist them in writing persuasive arguments for making improvements to the design of one service of your chosen company which in line with and supports the goals and strategy of the company.You will write an essay that includes anintroduction, body section (paragraphs) and conclusion(note that there are some resources we have provided below on this page on how to write and structure an essay). The body section of your essay will contain paragraphs. Each paragraph will make apersuasive argumentthat identifyone important area for improvementsupported by relevant course theory concepts (note that students need to conduct further reading beyond the textbook and beyond course readings of the relevant service operations management academic literature to makestrong academic literature supported argumentsfor your suggested improvements) and alsosupported with credible secondary researchevidence (eg from industry reports, industry journals, reputable newspapers etc) and suggesting realistic solutions for these areas of improvement.There may be many aspects you could improve but you will need toprioritize and focus on the most important ones! Be sure to clearly and persuasively argue in your essay using research evidence and theory to make a case for the most important opportunities for improvement in the design of one service process. You will need to provide secondary research evidence when arguing for making significant improvements (we recommend you only select two to three arguments/paragraphs for improving the design of the serviceand write concisely as the overall word count of this essay is only 1500 words). If it is a very large organisation/company that you have chosen, be sure to specify the specific service process you have chosen to focus on improving.Note that a key requirement of this assessment is that you need to clearlyinclude a minimum of 3 course seminar topics in your essay(ie select highly relevant course concepts from 3 or more seminar weeks).You will be assessed on thedepth and appropriateness of your international service operations academic literatureas well assecondary research(evidence based market and academic literature research to base your analysis and recommendations on) andcritical analysisas well as appropriatechoice and depth of service process related discussion. As well as your ability to demonstrate understanding and apply relevant theory and use literature to support your arguments (concepts we have covered in this course - be sure to include a reference when stating/applying key concepts in your report).Aminimum of 10 authoritative, relevant referencesmust be included and to achieve a high level of achievement in this assessment you will need to exceed the minimum - please also refer to the assessment marking rubric.The appropriate service operations mapping, service charting, service process mapping and tools of analysis and Service Operations Management concepts should be applied. You are encouraged to includeprocess maps, charts/graphs such as histograms or other visualizationsin this essay to support your arguments.Thepurpose of the processof the company should be should be clearly stated – what does service success look like through the eyes of the company and from the customer perspective? Reminder that you should also make clear what theoretical underpinning supports your discussion.AI StatementArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
