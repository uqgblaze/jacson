            "task_description": "<div class=\"collapsible collapsible--text\">\n<p>This is an individual assessment item (not a group assessment).</p>\n<p>You are required to write an <strong>essay</strong> of not more than <strong>1500 words</strong> excluding the reference section, on the topic of <strong>improving the design of one specific international service operations process</strong> using the same organization that your group chose for the oral presentation assessment. Note that in this Service Operations Management course we cover a wide range of concepts that students can use to map service operations and service processes. We have also cover concepts that can be applied to for instance identify and reduce waste, improve service quality, improve service process design etc and students should select and <strong>apply the most relevant course theory concepts</strong> to assist them in writing persuasive arguments for making improvements to the design of one service of your chosen company which in line with and supports the goals and strategy of the company.</p>\n<p>You will write an essay that includes an <strong>introduction, body section (paragraphs) and conclusion</strong> (note that there are some resources we have provided below on this page on how to write and structure an essay). The body section of your essay will contain paragraphs. Each paragraph will make a <strong>persuasive argument</strong> that identify <strong>one important area for improvement</strong> supported by relevant course theory concepts (note that students need to conduct further reading beyond the textbook and beyond course readings of the relevant service operations management academic literature to make <strong>strong academic literature supported arguments</strong> for your suggested improvements) and also <strong>supported with credible secondary research</strong> evidence (eg from industry reports, industry journals, reputable newspapers etc) and suggesting realistic solutions for these areas of improvement. </p>\n<p>There may be many aspects you could improve but you will need to <strong>prioritize and focus on the most important ones</strong>! Be sure to clearly and persuasively argue in your essay using research evidence and theory to make a case for the most important opportunities for improvement in the design of one service process. You will need to provide secondary research evidence when arguing for making significant improvements (<strong>we recommend you only select two to three arguments/paragraphs for improving the design of the service</strong> and write concisely as the overall word count of this essay is only 1500 words). If it is a very large organisation/company that you have chosen, be sure to specify the specific service process you have chosen to focus on improving. </p>\n<p>Note that a key requirement of this assessment is that you need to clearly <strong>include a minimum of 3 course seminar topics in your essay</strong> (ie select highly relevant course concepts from 3 or more seminar weeks).</p>\n<p>You will be assessed on the <strong>depth and appropriateness of your international service operations academic literature</strong> as well as <strong>secondary research</strong> (evidence based market and academic literature research to base your analysis and recommendations on) and <strong>critical analysis</strong> as well as appropriate <strong>choice and depth of service process related discussion</strong>. As well as your ability to demonstrate understanding and apply relevant theory and use literature to support your arguments (concepts we have covered in this course - be sure to include a reference when stating/applying key concepts in your report).</p>\n<p>A <strong>minimum of 10 authoritative, relevant references</strong> must be included and to achieve a high level of achievement in this assessment you will need to exceed the minimum - please also refer to the assessment marking rubric.</p>\n<p>The appropriate service operations mapping, service charting, service process mapping and tools of analysis and Service Operations Management concepts should be applied. You are encouraged to include <strong>process maps, charts/graphs such as histograms or other visualizations</strong> in this essay to support your arguments.</p>\n<p>The <strong>purpose of the process</strong> of the company should be should be clearly stated – what does service success look like through the eyes of the company and from the customer perspective? Reminder that you should also make clear what theoretical underpinning supports your discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
