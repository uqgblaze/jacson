Specifically, this assessment will examine their ability to use SQL Data Manipulation Language to return specific subsets of information that exist in a database.</p>\n<p>For this assignment, students will be presented with the simplified schema of an event management application. The goal of the application is to track both the events attended by users and relationships between users and other users. The system is then able to use this data to effectively market recommended events to users based on the events their friends have attended. You will be required to write SQL queries that answer higher-level questions about the data in this database. (Note: Your queries must compile using a MySQL DBMS). A sample database will be provided to help you test your queries.</p>\n<p>This will be broken down into 8 quizzes - 1 quiz per week.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Students are permitted to use any form of AI to any degree in completing this assignment. However, they must clearly document any use of AI in each instance. Specifically, students are required to include copies of their interactions with the AI tool as an appendix at the end of their submission.
