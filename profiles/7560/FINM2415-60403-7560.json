You will be asked to estimate the company's cost of capital, analyse its capital structure, and conduct corporate valuation. </li>\n<li>You are required to complete this assignment in a group of 4 - 5 members. Group members do not need to be from the same lecture or tutorial. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Group registration</strong>: It is important that you sign up for your group via Blackboard before starting the assignment. Group sign-up must be completed by <strong>5PM</strong> <strong>Friday of Week 3 (August 15)</strong>. You can use the Blackboard discussion board to look for group members. If you still have trouble forming your team, please let the teaching staff know as soon as possible. The assignment questions will be made available on Blackboard. </p>\n<p><strong>Peer assessment</strong>: Buddycheck Peer Evaluation will be used to compute your final individual grade on the Group Assignment. Completing the Peer Assessment is <strong>mandatory </strong>and failing to do so will result in <strong>a score of zero</strong> on the assignment. This policy is strictly applied.</p>\n<p>Peer Assessment will be completed on Blackboard and integrated into the Blackboard teams. Each team member will allocate 100 points between the members of their team. Justification of your distribution of points is essential if they are to be included in calculation of the final Peer Assessment Factor (PAF). In particular, if the score given to any team member deviates from the average by 10% or more, you must include a written justification. For example, in a team of 4, the average score will be 25. If you give someone 20 out of 25, you are saying that team member only deserves 80% (20/25) of the score on the team project. If everyone on the team gives the same score, then that team member will have a PAF of 0.8 and their project score will be 0.8 times the team score on the team assignment. Therefore, in a team of 4, all scores of 22.5 (27.5) and lower (higher) MUST be justified to count.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
