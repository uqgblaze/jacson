This decision is grounded in both educational research and the specific learning outcomes of the course.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Equity and Inclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>Team formation by the coordinator prevents the exclusion or isolation of students who may not yet have established peer networks, such as international, first-year, or remote learners. This supports UQ's equity and diversity goals and creates a more inclusive learning environment for all students.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Diversity of Perspectives</strong></h3>\n<p>Deliberately structured teams ensure a <strong>mix of backgrounds, experiences, and thinking styles</strong>, which enhances group creativity and problem-solving. Exposure to diverse viewpoints is especially important in a course focused on international business and cross-cultural negotiation in Asia.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Balanced Team Composition</strong></h3>\n<p>Coordinator-formed teams allow for the balancing of skills (e.g., communication, research, analytical ability), roles (e.g., leader, presenter, editor), and schedules to minimise dysfunction. Where possible, MBTI, prior performance, or student interest areas may be considered to create optimal team dynamics. The teaching team will issue you with a link to complete in Week 1 as part of the ice-breaker challenge and we will share our 'mildly scientific' profiles via a Padlet!</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Real-World Preparation</strong></h3>\n<p>In professional settings, individuals rarely choose their teams. Forming teams mimics this reality and helps students develop adaptability, collaboration, and interpersonal skills—core graduate attributes at UQ and essential competencies in international business contexts.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Minimising Group Conflict and Free-Riding</strong></h3>\n<p>Research shows that self-selected teams can lead to social loafing, uneven workloads, or dominance by certain individuals. Coordinator-created teams, combined with clear assessment criteria and optional peer review, reduce the likelihood of these issues.</p>\n<h3><br/></h3>\n<h3><strong>Task 1: Group Presentation (20%)</strong></h3>\n<p>Students will be assigned to teams by the course coordinator. Each team will deliver a <strong>20-minute oral presentation</strong> during one of the seminar weeks, focusing on a <strong>recent development or current event</strong> in an assigned Asian country.</p>\n<p>The presentation should explore the <strong>business implications of the issue</strong> for an <strong>international company operating in that country</strong>. Team and country allocations will be finalised by <strong>Week 3</strong>, with the schedule published on Blackboard.</p>\n<p>Your team must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the core <strong>problem(s)</strong> or <strong>strategic decisions</strong> arising from the event</li>\n<li>Apply relevant <strong>country and industry analysis frameworks</strong></li>\n<li>Examine <strong>implications for doing business</strong> in that specific Asian context</li>\n<li>Explore and evaluate <strong>alternative responses</strong> using <strong>qualitative and/or quantitative analysis</strong></li>\n<li>Present <strong>recommendations</strong> and a clear <strong>implementation plan</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Presentation Logistics:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duration: 20 minutes (maximum), followed by 5–10 minutes of Q&amp;A and class engagement</li>\n<li><strong>All team members</strong> must be present during delivery</li>\n<li>Use relevant theory and frameworks; <em>do not read </em>directly from notes or slides</li>\n<li>Submit PowerPoint slides to Blackboard <strong>prior to your presentation session</strong></li>\n<li>Include <strong>at least 10 authoritative references</strong>, of which a minimum of <strong>5 must be from refereed A/A* journals</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A compulsory practice run</strong> is required before your scheduled session</li>\n<li>Presentations will be <strong>recorded for assessment purposes</strong> in line with UQ policy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Peer assessment</strong> may be activated upon request. Please consult the Assessment section on Blackboard for the full <strong>marking rubric</strong>, <strong>presentation schedule</strong>, and <strong>team formation details</strong>.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h3><strong>Task 2: Q&amp;A Session (10%)</strong></h3>\n<p>Following the presentation, each team will participate in a <strong>5–10-minute Q&amp;A session</strong>, evaluated based on the following framework: <strong>ABCOD</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>nswer – <strong>B</strong>ack up – <strong>C</strong>onfirm –<strong>O</strong>pportunity– <strong>D</strong>epersonalise</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Answer</strong> – Clarify and directly respond to the question</li>\n<li><strong>Back Up</strong> – Support your answer with theory, examples, or evidence</li>\n<li><strong>Confirm</strong> – Check that your response addressed the question effectively</li>\n<li><strong>Opportunity</strong> – Treat the question as a chance to explore ideas further</li>\n<li><strong>Depersonalise</strong> – Respond professionally without being defensive</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This interactive component assesses your ability to think critically and engage with your peers under pressure.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h3><strong>Task 3: Individual Reflection (10%)</strong></h3>\n<p>Each student will submit an <strong>individual reflection</strong> on their learning from the team project.</p>\n<p>A structured <strong>template</strong> with guiding questions (at both the individual and team level) will be provided on Blackboard. This template must be used.</p>\n<p>Your reflection <strong><em>must be</em></strong> submitted in <strong>the same week</strong> as your team presentation. Late submissions may not be accepted unless prior arrangements are made in accordance with UQ policy.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h3><strong>AI Statement</strong></h3>\n<p>The use of <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> or <strong>Machine Translation (MT)</strong> tools is <strong>not permitted</strong> for any component of this oral presentation assessment, including the group presentation, Q&amp;A, or individual reflection.</p>\n<p>This is a <strong>communication-based task</strong> that requires <strong><em>original,</em></strong> <strong><em>student-generated content.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Unauthorised use of AI or MT may constitute academic misconduct under the UQ Student Code of Conduct.</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
