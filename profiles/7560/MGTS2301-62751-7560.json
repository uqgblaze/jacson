Submission: by module 8 (2nd session of students playing the simulation)Peer assessment: assignment involves peer assessment to moderate group marks.Rationale: simulation provide students a WIL experience that lays the foundation for their degree. The focus of the assessment will be on their plan, actions, and recommendations in front of an industry audience.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
