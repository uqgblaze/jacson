Please see detailed marking rubrics on the course blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an individual assignment</strong>. The assignment (i.e. report) is 2000 (+/-10%) words in length and it is <strong>worth 40% of the total course weighting.</strong>   </p>\n<p><strong>Aim: </strong>The primary aim of the assignment is to enable students to see the intricate connection between theory and practice SHRM processes through a case method. The assignment also aims to help students develop analytical and practical skills in the design, implementation and evaluation of SHRM. Cases are known to provide a context to experience real-world challenges that are enveloped in complicated processes and uncertainties. The cases are therefore a strong teaching tool and a platform where students engage in experiential learning process by getting them to teach themselves and each other. Altogether, cases help the students to learn the value of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>responding actively and constructively to the SHRM issues in organisations,</li>\n<li>gaining multiple perspectives on situations by using theory, concepts and research findings,</li>\n<li>recognizing that a situation may involve many problems and that different stakeholders will most likely experience divergent views and problems</li>\n<li>develop an action orientation and a willingness to take some calculated risks when information is not complete,</li>\n<li>appreciate the complexity of translating proposed solutions into comprehensive and detailed plans for action and</li>\n<li>seeking to understand the consequences and limits of managerial actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Background to the Assignment</strong></p>\n<p>Often, family businesses connote small businesses. However, family businesses vary in sizes ranging from small to large businesses. In particular, family businesses include some of the largest and longest surviving businesses, not only in Australia, but around the world. The major names in family businesses that readily come to mind in Australia include Packer, Lowy, Murdoch, Smorgon and Myer (see Kras, FBA). In Australia, family businesses constitute 67% of all private sector firms and employ 50% of the workforce. Recent surveys estimate the combined wealth of family businesses in Australia at $4.3 trillion, over 3.5 times the value of all companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (Kras, FBA).</p>\n<p>While family businesses are vibrant, dynamic and contribute significantly to the Australian economy, they are also faced with complexities that are sometimes beyond those of the corporate organizations. For example, in terms of recruitment, do you employ the best qualified applicant, or do you give preference to your children? What does performance evaluation look like for your children and others working in this environment? The above represent some of the difficult decisions faced by those managing family businesses. This semester in MGTS7603, we focus on family businesses to understand their peculiar challenges and how these are connected with and may be improved with effective SHRM. Especially, you will be reporting to the Executive Manager/Director of Human Resources(or someone in a similar role) of the chosen Family Business on how the challenges identified can be improved or resolved. </p>\n<p><strong>The Key Tasks:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>As an individual, you will need to decide on a medium to large family business organisation where there is a SHRM challenge (e.g. recruitment, learning and development, work design issues). In deciding on what organisation to examine as a case study, you may want to first of all consult the media (e.g. business review, daily newspaper articles) or the Australian Stock Exchange List for medium to large Family Business organizations for live-cases to get a quick impression of what family business organisation may be currently experiencing SHRM challenges. You may also choose a family business that is in your local area.</li>\n<li>You may then follow this up with a web search to know more about the organisation and face to face interactions with the organisational members.</li>\n<li>You may interview relevant organisational member(s) about the major SHRM challenge that you have identified in this small family business to get an in-depth perspective on the problem. You will NEED to review literature before you conduct your interview. Before a decision is made to study a given family business organisation (e.g. Ray White, Adam &amp; Eva, Environclean Australia, Aroma Cafe, Golden Ox Restaurant and Pillow Talk) as a live case, you will need to discuss this with your tutor and/or course co-ordinator. They will ensure that the case is rich enough for your analysis. No two individuals will be able to study the same case for the purpose of the assignment. The course coordinator and tutor will keep a list of the live cases and the individual that has nominated to work on the relevant case. Nomination for each of the cases will be on \"first come, first serve\" basis. Nomination to study a written or live case MUST be completed by Teaching Week 1. Please consult the teaching team before you lock down the choice of the organisation that you would like to study.</li>\n<li>Based on the content of MGTS7603 learning activities, you will determine the major challenges or problematic issues (e.g. Design of work, strategic planning, performance management, diversity management, rewarding people, employee development and career management or any other current issues in SHRM and as evident in your case. Also determine why is it important to study and resolve the challenge(s). Students MUST use excerpts from their interview and literature to support their claims. More information will be provided on the process of analysing a case during the semester.</li>\n<li>Also, outline the evidence-based triggers (e.g. historical, contextual and technological) of the SHRM or people issues and how this particular family business is currently managing the challenge/problem. In this case, you may want to conduct some analyses (e.g. SWOT, PESTLE) into the internal and external environments of the family business. You may also use the Hartel &amp; Fujimoto's (2010) Continuous HRM model (CHRM) to conduct a situation analysis to clearly identify the contributing factor to the SHRM problem(s).</li>\n<li>Then conduct a comprehensive review of literature on the major issues as evident in your case and especially identify the major schools of thought around these challenges/issues.</li>\n<li>During your literature review, you must isolate a theory/model or set of theories/models (e.g. a model of strategic management process, workflow analysis model) that best explain the issues and actions/behaviours of the issues in your case. You are NOT limited to the theories that will be discussed in the course. If you are in doubt, talk to your course lecturer. Preferably, use one or at most two theories as anchor for your assignment. Please refer to the UQBS Assignment Writing Guide on the Course blackboard especially for a detailed guidance on how to structure literature review for your report. The librarian will assist you in locating the relevant databases for your literature review.</li>\n<li>Then, you will critically examine the SHRM issue(s) in your case and based on the learning issues in this course, you will determine whether or not the SHR Manager (or others in similar roles) have managed the SHRM issue(s) successful or unsuccessfully. To achieve this, you may also draw on the CHRM model to decide on the relevant options and literature review for more evidence-based approach to resolve the issue(s). Also excerpts from your interview MUST be used to buttress your discussions and arguments.</li>\n<li>Also, you will suggest at least two alternative ways (options) in which the SHRM challenges can be managed better or resolved. Where appropriate, you should outline the extent to which the solutions depend on the characteristics of the family business, nature of its strategic objectives, nature of business, organisational environment -national and international- and or industry. In your discussion, you must evaluate the options and provide reasons for why you think one option may be a preferred as an appropriate people management strategy.</li>\n<li>A clear and concise articulation of the connection between SHRM theory/models &amp; practice must be made. For example, in your report it must be evident that you are logically connecting theory with your identified SHRM challenge/problem and especially using relevant literature for your connections. Please note: You must use relevant theory (including a thorough literature review using quality journal articles) and excerpts from your interview to buttress your arguments throughout the report.</li>\n<li>Also develop a clear set of recommendations to the Executive Manager/Director of Human Resources(or someone in a similar role) in the Family Business on how your preferred option may be implemented. In doing so, students will need to link their recommendations clearly and logically linked with your analyses and evaluation. Also excerpts from your interview MUST be used to buttress your arguments.</li>\n<li>In a reflective mode, also identify three learning issues that you have taken away as an individual from the case analysis.</li>\n<li>Evaluation: Report rubrics will be enforced. Please see the course blackboard for the rubrics.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Process: </strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Report Outline</strong>: Draw a report outline and discuss with your facilitator/course lecturer</p>\n<p><strong>Report Proper</strong>: Write out your report. Students are encouraged to consult the UQBS Assignment Writing Guide in writing their reports. The UQBS Assignment Writing Guide will be on the course Blackboard. Additional guidance will be provided in the lectures and tutorials throughout the semester.</p>\n<p>A minimum of <strong>15 references should </strong>be used, 10 of which should be recent journal articles (i.e. 2014-2024).

(300 words).</li>\n<li>Which learning topics resonated with you throughout the semester and why? In answering this question, you must identify at least 2 major topics you have come across during the semester and how and why they have positively impacted you? (600 words).</li>\n<li>What have you learnt about strategic Human Resource Management in general and /or yourself and how you think your learnings will make you a better Strategic Human Resource Manager or a better person. In this case, you need to consider your previous approach to human resource management (e.g. whether it was strategic or not before you engaged MGTS7603), think about your shortcomings before you engaged the course and how the course may have assisted you in improving upon your shortcomings. In what ways do you think your learnings from the course may be able to help you overcome the current challenges in Strategic Human Resource Management (600 words).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Support and further information about assessment 3 is available on Blackboard.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
