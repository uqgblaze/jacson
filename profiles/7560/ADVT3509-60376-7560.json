The Pitch presentation slides deck will be due for submission on the day of your presentation. The Pitch presentation will be restricted to 15 minutes per team. Presentations must be professional as if you were presenting your solution to the Client. All group members must be present on Pitch day and must speak in the presentation, but not necessarily for the same amount of time.</p>\n<p>Detailed assessment guidelines and the marking criteria sheet for this group assessment will be posted on Blackboard and discussed in workshops. The Pitch presentation must be delivered/submitted in English. <strong>Please Note: </strong>The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p>\n<p>Group members are expected to contribute equally, fulfilling the tasks agreed on early in the semester. If there are disagreements in relation to team members' contributions that cannot be resolved, students must bring the problem to the attention of the Tutor/Lecturer/Course Coordinator as early as possible. Students will be required to complete a Self and Peer Review Evaluation, reflecting on their own and their member's contributions during the development of the group assessment items. Students' final individual grades will be determined by the team's project grade and individual results of the Peer evaluations. Further details will be outlined in the assessment guidelines document on Blackboard. Team members who work in good faith will not experience grade adjustments, while individuals who perform below expectations or fail to pull their weight will experience a negative grade adjustment. The Course Coordinator reserves the right to adjust peer evaluations to ensure fairness. Students are advised to be proactive and make expectations of one another clear from the start. Poor communication is often the source of discrepancies. Any problems that arise are expected to be brought to the Course Coordinator's attention well before the assessment submission deadlines.</p>\n<p><strong>Student use of AI in assessment:</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic, and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</p>\n<p>A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
