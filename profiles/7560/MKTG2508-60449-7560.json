It will involve qualitative and quantitative research, and literature review. Students will analyse the current brand strategy and recommend a complete brand strategy plan.Detailed project guidelines will be available on Blackboard by the first week of tutorials. This will cover action steps, outputs, and detailed marking criteria. There will be many references to the project throughout the semester in the tutorials. Examples of projects from prior semesters will be available on the Blackboard.Student teams will present their completed brand strategy audit toward the end of the semester. Teams will also submit the written documents at the time of their presentation.PART B: BRAND AUDIT PRESENTATION (TEAM 40%)Due Date:During tutorials in teaching weeks 12 and 13.Weight: 40%Length: 18-20 minute presentation plus 5 minutes question and answer (Q&A) sessionThe assignment must be submitted electronically via the Online Submission Folder on the course Blackboard site. The digital copy must be submitted before the start of the tutorial.In teams, you will present your brand strategy audit. The presentation will include a summary of the current brand strategy, the results of the focus group, survey, and strategic and tactical recommendations.Teams will make presentations of their brand strategy audit toward the end of the semester, at dates to be assigned by the 3rd week of class at the latest. It is important that teams work well together and that everyone does their fair share of the work. Therefore, marks may be adjusted for team members who do less work than their fair share or fail to behave like good team members (e.g., don't show up to meetings), based on the evidence of peer assessment forms. Adjustments will only be made where there is a problem in the team.NOTE: You should keep notes on your participation and contribution to the project.Also, if/when a problem is developing, you need to keep notes on the relative contribution of team members. Instructions for how to submit the peer assessment form will be provided during the tutorial and on the course Blackboard website.Survey Participation: You are required to complete at least 10 surveys.PART C: PEER REVIEW OF FOCUS GROUP (Individual Assignment 5%)Due Date:During tutorials in teaching Weeks 8 and 9Weight: 5%(2.5% per feedback sheet- best 2 out of 3 will be selected). Students are required to be participants of at least 3 focus groups.Failure to attend at least 3 focus groups will result in 0 marks allocated for PART C.Length:3 x 1-page feedback sheetsIndividually,participants of the focus group (non-presenting team) are to provide feedback and constructive criticism for at least three focus group sessions. The analysis should provide feedback in a supportive and non-confrontational environment to your colleagues. The reason to use a peer review is for its role in your skill development, improving learning and helping students to improve their performance and contribute with ideas for the survey and final presentation.You need to complete a feedback sheet and 1) upload it to Blackboard; 2) email it to the group conducting the focus group (before the end of the tutorial). The marks and comments for all reviews will be recorded on the same marking rubric and given back to you in Week 13.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes.AI StatementArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
