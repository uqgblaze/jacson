You will need to complete all three components (Part A and B) to receive a mark for this assessment task. </p>\n<p>For this assessment task, you need to appraise a tourism destination. </p>\n<p><strong>Prospective destinations</strong> </p>\n<p>You MUST select one (1) of the following destinations (your client). There are a limited number of representatives per destination available, allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. You must confirm your selected destination through blackboard.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brisbane (<a href=\"https://www.beda.brisbane.qld.au/\">www.beda.brisbane.qld.au</a>) </li>\n<li>Gold Coast (<a href=\"https://www.destinationgoldcoast.com/\">www.destinationgoldcoast.com</a>) </li>\n<li>Sunshine Coast (<a href=\"https://www.visitsunshinecoast.com.au/\">www.visitsunshinecoast.com.au</a>) </li>\n<li>Southern Queensland Country (<a href=\"https://www.southernqueenslandcountry.com.au/\">www.southernqueenslandcountry.com.au</a>) </li>\n<li>Fraser Coast (<a href=\"https://www.visitfrasercoast.com/\">https://www.visitfrasercoast.com/</a>) </li>\n<li>Bundaberg (<a href=\"https://www.bundabergregion.org/\">https://www.bundabergregion.org/</a>) </li>\n<li>Gladstone (<a href=\"https://www.gladstoneregion.info/\">https://www.gladstoneregion.info/</a>) </li>\n<li>Capricorn (<a href=\"https://capricornenterprise.com.au/\">https://capricornenterprise.com.au/</a>) </li>\n<li>Mackay (<a href=\"https://www.mackayregion.com/\">https://www.mackayregion.com/</a>) </li>\n<li>Whitsundays (<a href=\"https://www.tourismwhitsundays.com.au/\">https://www.tourismwhitsundays.com.au/</a>) </li>\n<li>Townsville North Queensland (<a href=\"https://www.townsvilleenterprise.com.au/\">https://www.townsvilleenterprise.com.au/</a>) </li>\n<li>Tropical North Queensland (<a href=\"https://www.tourismtnq.org.au/)\">https://www.tourismtnq.org.au/)</a> </li>\n<li>Outback Queensland (<a href=\"https://www.outbackqueensland.com.au/)\">https://www.outbackqueensland.com.au/)</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Submission Format: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part A Destination Audit Spreadsheet</strong> </p>\n<p>You are to conduct an external resource audit of the chosen destination from the list above and critically evaluate all the relevant natural, cultural and support resources. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A spreadsheet template is available on Blackboard to guide the audit process. </li>\n<li>You have to identify the resources that reflect the destination characteristics, identifying more natural or cultural resources depending on the destination type. The audit must cover all resource sub-types, (five natural, four cultural, four support) with at least one resource. The identified resources must reflect the destination type, thus allowing for more natural or cultural resources depending on the type of destination. </li>\n<li>You are to critically evaluate each resource's appeal, quality, and uniqueness. </li>\n<li>You then identify and reflect on the main management challenges and possible strategies to overcome those. </li>\n<li>Your completed spreadsheet must be submitted as part of this assessment, and completion provides the foundation for you to complete Part B. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Part B Infographic (B1) and Destination Forum Panel Discussion (B2)</strong> </p>\n<p>Based on your research and resource audit spreadsheet, you will prepare an infographic (using Canva’s or Piktochart 's Infographic free function, or similar) from a destination marketing perspective. An infographic is a visual representation of an idea or data, and yours should be succinct, entertaining, and eye-catching. It should cite the relevant literature and incorporate informative text and engaging images or graphics to appeal and explain your findings to your audiences. (<a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">https://www.canva.com/</a>) (<a href=\"https://create.piktochart.com/infographic\">https://create.piktochart.com/infographic</a>). Your infographic should address the following aspects: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>An overview of the destination (geographical location, types of attractions, visitor segment and statistics etc) </li>\n<li>A summary of the most relevant two (2) examples of natural, cultural and support resources available at this destination. This will require you to inform on the resource i) quality, ii) uniqueness and iii) appeal for 2 natural resources, 2 cultural resources and 2 social resources; </li>\n<li>Explain the most important two (2) resource management challenges for your destination. Evidence-based justification of the identified challenges is necessary. </li>\n<li>Address each challenge strategically with one (1) possible management strategy that will overcome the challenge. The infographic includes, thus, two (2) strategies, one for each of the most important challenges. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your research should be based on recent academic sources (published within the past 10 years). Attach your reference list following the APA reference guide on the audit and the infographic. </p>\n<p>Following your Audit and Infographic submission, you will participate in a Destination Forum Panel Discussion. Each panel will consist of students who have focused on the same geographical region. The panel discussion is an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of your work by justifying your decisions and engaging with different perspectives from your peers.  </p>\n<p>You will need to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a brief (1 minute) verbal overview of your infographic: summarize the key resources for tourism development and key markets. </li>\n<li>Engage in a facilitated discussion with your group responding to questions from peers and the facilitator on various topics such as destination management and competitiveness, markets, management challenges and solutions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use of AI in Assessment </strong></p>\n<p>The Destination Forum Panel Discussion (Part B) is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted in this component of the assessment. Any attempted use of AI or MT may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<p>You may use AI to support the preparation of your Audit (Part A) and Infographic (Part B). Students using AI must disclose one AI Statement and attach an Appendix with the prompts given to AI and the results provided by AI. A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
