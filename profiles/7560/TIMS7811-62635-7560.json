The task for this assignment is to create an image-based essay</p>\n<p>describing an innovation. It will consist primarily of images (e.g. photos; graphs etc) presented to the class on the due date. You will have to upload your</p>\n<p>presentation to Blackboard before commencement of class. The photo essay should be structured as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Select an innovation that a random person on the street would not be aware of (e.g. don't tell us about your iPhone!). Draw on course concepts to</p>\n<p>describe the type of innovation, what makes it innovative, and how and why it was developed.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Identify and illustrate the \"enabling technologies\" that needed to be in place for this innovation to be created and successfully diffuse.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 3:</strong> Drawing on course concepts to identify the \"winners\" and \"losers\" associated with this innovation's diffusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 4:</strong> Drawing on course concepts, identify what you believe was the single most important innovation leadership challenge associated with this</p>\n<p>innovation's development and diffusion.</p>\n<p>Ideally, I would like you to take as many of the photos as possible yourself. One of the points of this assignment is to make some of these ideas about</p>\n<p>innovations more tangible, and figuring out how to take a good picture of something that is not a product is a good way to do this. However, if you cannot</p>\n<p>take original pictures, you can source (or generate) images from other sources. You can also do this for things that are just impossible to photograph. I'm</p>\n<p>not too worried about the quality of the photos, as long as I can tell what they are and how they fit into your story.</p>\n<p>Please also note that not all students have to present but ALL students must contribute to compiling the presentation and be present to answer questions</p>\n<p>from the panel.</p>\n<p><strong>Peer Evaluation: </strong>Peer evaluation using provided form has to be submitted individually by ALL team members as part of your team assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>AI STATEMENT</strong></p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
