These seminars will follow the format of a Management Team Meeting. Students will be allocated to teams will play a role on the management team of the case company. During the seminar, the management team will be asked to evaluate and make recommendations on the case company's business-level and corporate-level strategies and future directions. Students will be assessed on their preparation for and participation in the Management Team Meeting and the quality of the strategic advice their team provides to the case company as the output of their meeting.</p>\n<p>Schedule of case organisations:</p>\n<p>Week 5 – Myer</p>\n<p>Week 6 – Wesfarmers</p>\n<p>Week 7 – Aristocrat Leisure</p>\n<p>Week 8 - Qantas</p>\n<p>You will have FOUR opportunities to be assessed on your performance and your BEST THREE marks out of 10 will count towards your final mark for the course (3 x 10% = 30%). Students who are absent for a week of assessment will receive a mark of zero. A student who has legitimate grounds for an absence from an assessment week under the University's assessment policy must contact the course coordinator prior to, or within 24 hours of, the missed assessment and must provide appropriate supporting documentation.  </p>\n<p>In-Seminar</p>\n<p>At the start of the assessable team meetings, students will be allocated to a team, which represents a Management Team of the case company. Students will join their Management Team at their team’s assigned table. In the first phase, Management Team members will be presented with AI generated analysis of the firm's external and internal environments. Teams will then review this analysis and identify where it could be improved based on their understanding of the PESTEL, Porter and VRIN frameworks. Teams will then use this information to produce a second AI generated analysis of the firm's external and internal environments. They will then assess how the second analysis has improved on the first AI generated analysis. </p>\n<p>In the second phase, the seminar coordinator will allocate specific analysis tasks to students to work together to apply course theory to evaluate decision making alternatives for the case company. Facilitators will move around the various Management Teams to (i) probe for more theoretically grounded reasoning to deepen learning of course material, and (ii) assure that individual students are contributing to their team’s Management Team Meeting. The seminar coordinator will also facilitate whole-class debriefs at regular intervals in which Management Teams will be asked to report on and defend their evaluations of alternative courses of action for the case company.</p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: A student who does not remain for the entirety of the in-class assessment will receive a mark of zero for the assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Organisations represent a complex environment, featuring a mix of actors with different motivations, levels of influence, and bases of power. These dynamics are most apparent during periods of organisational restructuring, where textbook models of best practice in organisational design are often rendered impossible by clashes between different actors motivated by competing interests. Students will be introduced to a hypothetical organisation, Millennium Airlines, which is restructuring to ensure its ongoing competitiveness in the face of challenging circumstances in its external and internal environment. Using information about the organisation and theory on organisational politics and structure, students will recommend a restructure which accounts for political realities of the organisation by completing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a zoom-style format (only) video brief to a member of the organisation's Executive which justifies their recommended structure</li>\n<li>a hierarchical diagram (only) of an ideal structure for the organisation</li>\n<li>a hierarchical diagram (only) of a recommended structure for the organisation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Video briefs must be in a face-to-face, zoom-style format.
