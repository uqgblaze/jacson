The Course Coordinator reserves the right to adjust peer evaluations to ensure fairness.</li>\n<li>Students are advised to be proactive and make their expectations of one another clear from the start. Poor communication is often the source of discrepancies.</li>\n<li>Each group will be required to submit details of the contributions of each member.
