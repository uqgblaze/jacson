You will need to successfully complete a weekly quiz at the end of the Blackboard Module so you can get access to the case study materials each week.</p>\n<p>In this course, you will be placed into a tutorial for the semester. Within your tutorial, you will be placed into a group for the full semester.</p>\n<p>As a joint formative and summative learning exercise in weeks 4 to 12, your group will prepare a brief executive summary (500-600 words) relating to the case study. This assessment requires you to only submit five (5) executive summaries for marking over the semester. Whether you choose to prepare an executive summary each week is up to your group to decide.</p>\n<p>Completing more summaries will be helpful for you in making sure the 5 executive summaries you submit are of a high standard.</p>\n<p>The questions you need to respond to in your executive summaries relating to the case studies are available in the corresponding weekly folder in the Learning Resources section in Blackboard.</p>\n<p>Under the guidance and feedback from your tutor you will discuss the case study in class with your group and prepare and submit the executive summary in the class via Blackboard.</p>\n<p>As part of the executive summary, the group will need to attach a list that details the contribution of each member of the group to the final presentation. Your tutor will provide you with feedback on your submission each week so that you can make improvements where needed in your subsequent submissions.</p>\n<p>Your contribution to the group work and the Executive Summary will contribute to your final grade for the course. This is a group assessment and you cannot complete the Executive Summaries on your own.</p>\n<p>At the end of the semester, you will be required to submit a peer assessment via the Assessment folder in Blackboard of the other members of the group. Peer results will be used to adjust students' individual group assignment results.</p>\n<p>The executive summary is worth 45%, which includes 5% for peer review to determine your final grade.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.
