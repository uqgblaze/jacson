Choose an organisation to which your team has access and that has a marketing campaign currently or recently in market. The organisation can operate in any sector, be well-established, a start-up, and can be based in any geographic market. Your analysis can focus upon any particular aspect of marketing in the course and the presentation should be no longer than 10 minutes with 5 minutes for Q & A from the audience.Your presentation should include:1. Brief introduction to the organisation and sector in which it operates;2. Summary of the campaign strategy;3. Dashboard showing key metrics used to evaluate the campaign, with justification;4. Assessment of campaign effectiveness; and5. Evidence-based recommendations for the next campaign.Teams can self-organise in any way that works for them. It is recommended that the project team works as a cross-functional team with different members fulfilling different functions (e.g., background research, analytics, design, presenting results), and that only 1-2 team members actually present the results of the analysis.Peer Review: Group members are expected to contribute equally, fulfilling the tasks agreed on. If there are disagreements in relation to team members' contributions that cannot be resolved, students must bring the problem to the attention of their Course Coordinator as early as possible. Students can elect to undertake a Peer Review process, which can influence the marks of those who do not contribute to group work.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
