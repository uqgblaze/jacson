The reflective entries will determine how well you use acquired knowledge and attributes and your ability to face challenging work tasks. The daily diary entries form the basis for compiling a critical reflection piece. Reflection on experience is useful when learning from diverse observations, ideas and data. Reflection helps to connect new ideas with what we already know. Documenting experiences helps foster reflection, the creation of new insights, and as a result, increase learning. This essay type assignment will enable you to illustrate self-awareness, personal and professional growth, and improved innovation, entrepreneurship and startup practices.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

You will present your proposal for feedback in Assignment 1 (Presentation).Task:Identify and analyse an innovation and/or entrepreneurship issue relevant to your placement, a startup or incubator/accelerator that you are involved with, build a business case for your own startup, or write a report for a technology commercialisation project. The assessment piece must demonstrate thoughtful application of entrepreneurship and innovation theories or more specifically, venture creation and growth practice. You must conduct research and submit an academic based paper using reviewed academic sources (for placements), write a technology commercialisation report or present a detailed business case (own startups). You must include relevant references topeer-reviewedor other acceptable academic sources such as journals, conference papers, and texts. In the case of technology commercialisation and business cases, you will have to present primary data that you have obtained via experimentation or other data gathering methods.It is preferred that you submit work that are closely related to your placement or selected Work Integrated Learning (WIL) option. The main research objective/s or question/s should therefore be related to something that you have encountered during your placement that you want to investigate further by applying existing theories and research. You could, for example, investigate the practical validity of Sarasvathy’s Effectuation Principles and/or Process by critically discussing the application thereof to a case study (a startup that you have worked with during your placement or are currently involved with). I will provide you with an overview and supporting documentation on three entrepreneurial theories (Effectuation, Lean Startup and Design Thinking) that you could apply in various ways to your WIL experience.Just be very clear on what you want to achieve with your research report and how you would go about (research method – literature review, direct observation, ect.) uncovering insights that would enable you to answer your research questions or attain your research objectives.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
