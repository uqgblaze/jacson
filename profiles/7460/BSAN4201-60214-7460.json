It is based on the Case Study.There are three parts to this:A tailored CV. The CV is to be two pages or less in lengthA tailored cover letter. The cover letter is to be be two pages or less in length,A portfolio presentation of relevant capabilities from university projects. The portfolio is to be three pages or less in length including images.Your portfolio will emphasise previous work you have done (e.g. on Github, blogs, Uni projects, etc) and the CV and cover letter will be tailored to the job.Don’t get into the detail of what you would do, how you would do it, etc. You need to convince someone who doesn’t see value in doing the project that it is worthwhile taking you on board and engaging you to do the work – they won’t understand detailed technical explanations.AI Statement:This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

After the third lecture you should be in a position to begin working on the presentation. The case study is deliberately vague and doesn’t contain all details required. You will be required to fill in these gaps (explained in lectures).Each group’s presentation will be 15 minutes long and will be presented to the class and should be done via Powerpoint or Keynote or similar and will be done over Zoom to allow the recording of the presentations.Students will be in groups of 3 (or 2 or 4 if a final group of 3 is not possible) and it is expected each student will present for 5 minutes (7.5 minutes per student in case there is a group with 2 students or 4 minutes in case there is a group of 4 students). Students will be presenting to the class.If you are unable to find a group of 3 to join, please let us know and we will connect you with other students. You will be expected to have sorted out your group by week 3.Note that although the presentation is in a group,marks will be individual based on your partof the presentation.AI Statement:This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
