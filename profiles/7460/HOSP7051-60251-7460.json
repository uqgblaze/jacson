            "task_description": "This assessment aims to comprehensively evaluate students’ understanding of global hotel industry operations. It focuses on assessing their ability to engage effectively with industry professionals, as well as their reflective learning and practical coordination skills within a real-world context. This assessment involves the following components:#1 Student-Led Mini-Industry Forum (Group 40%)Starting from Week 4, industry experts will be invited by the teaching team to deliver 30–40-minute guest talks each week on specific industry trends, problems, or best practices.Prior to the talks, student teams will be responsible for designing the format of the mini-industry forum, including delivering a 10-minute student presentation, chairing the industry talk, preparing relevant questions, and facilitating the topic discussion.Student presentations (20%):Students will be divided into small groups and tasked with identifying and analysing a real-world hotel industry problem or challenge, drawing on their understanding of the hotel operations model taught in week 2. Each group will then present their problem analysis and proposed solutions in a 10-minute class presentation.Industry forum design, engagement and student questions (20%):During the industry guest talk, students will be expected to actively listen, take notes, and participate in the subsequent Q&A session. Following industry expert’s presentations, student teams will take the lead in asking questions and engaging in a deeper discussion of the topic.Students will be evaluated on their ability to design mini-industry forums, the quality and relevance of the questions they ask, as well as their critical analysis and responses to the industry expert’s answers.To support each team, the teaching staff will offer ongoing mentorship and consultation, ensuring that students receive the guidance and resources necessary to succeed. Presentation order will be scheduled during the semester from Week 4 to Week 10, aligning with the chosen topics and availability of industry guest speakers.Evaluation criteria and marking sheets will be provided in blackboard.#2 Teamwork evaluation & reflection (Individual 10%)Teamwork evaluation and reflection will be assessed. All team members must complete a ‘peer evaluation’ for each of their team members and submit online in your Blackboard site through the platform Buddycheck. The purpose of this evaluation and reflection process is to provide an opportunity to learn about how each student contributed to the group project. Collaborative skills are a basic graduate attribute that all students should enter the workplace with. The assessment criteria for collaborative skills are:1.Contribution– team member contributed to the process required to complete the assignment.2.Knowledge– team member contributed knowledge, opinions, and skills to team discussions and work completion.3.Collaboration & Communication– team member collaborated and communicated with others in the team and fulfilled their individual roles within the team.4.Responsibility– team member accepted responsibility for the team’s assignment outcome.There are several purposes for completing it:·        To evaluate a student’s ability to critically evaluate others·        To determine if each group member participated equally·        To evaluate project-team practices and effectiveness which occurs in project management in the real worldAI StatementArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
