A student's final grade for this assessment item could be altered based on feedback from the Peer evaluations.</li>\n<li>Team members that work in good faith will not experience grade adjustments, while individuals that perform below expectations or fail to pull their weight will experience a negative grade adjustment. The Course Coordinator reserves the right to adjust peer evaluations to ensure fairness.</li>\n<li>Students are advised to be proactive and make expectations of one another clear from the start.
