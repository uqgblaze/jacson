All learning team members must contribute toward the group presentation.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes.Criteria & MarkingSelf and Peer Review Process:Group members are expected to contribute equally, fulfilling the tasks agreed on early in the semester. If there are disagreements in relation to team members' contributions that cannot be resolved, students must bring the problem to the attention of the Course Coordinator/Tutor as early as possible.Students will be required to complete a Self and Peer Review Evaluation, reflecting on their own and their member's contributions during the development of the group assessment items. A student's final grade for this assessment item could be altered based on feedback from the Peer evaluations.Team members that work in good faith will not experience grade adjustments, while individuals that perform below expectations or fail to pull their weight will experience a negative grade adjustment. The Course Coordinator reserves the right to adjust peer evaluations to ensure fairness.Students are advised to be proactive and make expectations of one another clear from the start. Poor communication is often the source of discrepancies.It is expected that any problems that arise will be brought to the Course Coordinator's attention well before the assessment submission deadlines.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

This could be measured, for example, in terms of financial performance, reputation, or corporate social responsibility (CSR).Describe the actions or inactions leading to success or failure using at least three organisational behaviour theories/concepts covered in the course.Critically evaluate the short and long-term consequences/impact of these actions or inactions.Make recommendations for what could have been done better. In making these recommendations, be pragmatic and specific (i.e. make recommendations that are viable and within the organisationâ€™s capacity to implement).Criteria & Marking:For detailed marking criteria and rubrics, please see the Blackboard site.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
