A student's final grade for this assessment item could be altered based on feedback from the Peer evaluations.</li>\n<li>Team members that work in good faith will not experience grade adjustments, while individuals that perform below expectations or fail to pull their weight will experience a negative grade adjustment. The Course Coordinator reserves the right to adjust peer evaluations to ensure fairness.</li>\n<li>Students are advised to be proactive and make expectations of one another clear from the start. Poor communication is often the source of discrepancies.</li>\n<li>It is expected that any problems that arise will be brought to the Course Coordinator's attention well before the assessment submission deadlines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
