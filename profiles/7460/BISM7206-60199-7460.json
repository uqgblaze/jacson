Accordingly,students are required to work in teamsunless prior, special arrangements are in place with the course coordinator.Zero markswill apply if this requirement is not addressed.This assessment task provides students with the opportunity to demonstrate:effective collaboration and teamwork skills;demonstrate their understanding of database concepts; andtheir ability to design, develop and implement a well-structured relational database that effectively supports the given case study business requirementsStudents will also be required to demonstrate their knowledge and ability to use SQL. While it is anticipated that the fundamental knowledge and skills will be developed through lecture and tutorial materials, students will be required to undertake additional research to further develop the skills required to successfully complete this assessment task.Students are required to submit a professional business report including professional modelling diagrams, supporting documentation and SQL scripts using app.diagrams.net for drawing models (freely available on the Web). SQL scripts are to be created using MySQL Workbench software which is available on UQ's \"Digital Workspace\" or Virtual Machine and in the BEL labs. In addition,students must submit confidential self and peer evaluations to enable assessment of team member contributions.Assessment guidelines along with team requirements, the case study description, marking rubric and specifications will be available under the Assessment link on Blackboard.AI Statement:This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
