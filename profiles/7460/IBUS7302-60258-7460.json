To reassure students, the Assignment Groups are created to have as equal numbers of students as possible. However, once we proceed past Week 4, it is unfair to ask group members to change groups thus some groups may have unequal numbers. Please see the assignment guide and check Blackboard for more information.Each group member must submit their individual contributions to the team assignment on Blackboard to ensure proper documentation of participation.Although the submission will not be marked, not submitting the individual contribution materials will exclude you from receiving the group’s debate mark, since it implies you did not contribute to the group assignment.Make sure you document your contribution. If your group use online files, use track changes to show your contribution, and save the files as evidence.Late submission penalty applies for Individual Contribution and Group Outline.Academic Integrity policy is in effect. Note: It is the responsibility of each individual and group to adhere to Academic Integrity. Plagiarised materials (high similarity match) will receive zero marks. You must include a reference list of the materials you used.A reference list of all materials used should also be included; minimum of three peer-reviewed reference per team member.Plagiarism and/or AI usage including translation APPs will result in zero marks for the assignment!Peer evaluations will be conducted for this assignment.Peer evaluations are mandatoryand must besubmitted within five days of the assessment due date. Failure to submit a review may result in a decrease in marks.All students in the group will receive the same mark and each member will have the opportunity to evaluate the contributions of their peers using four criteria.If a student is absent from the scheduled presentation without a valid excuse, they will receive no marks for the assignment.Important Mark Moderation Based on Peer ReviewThe moderation of individual marks will be based on the following overall average peer review score:5.0 (demonstrated full contribution to group),no deduction from group mark.4.01 to 4.99 (demonstrated only satisfactory contribution to group),5% deduction from group mark.3.01 to 3.99 (demonstrated sub-standard contribution to group),15% deduction from group mark.2.01 to 2.99 (demonstrated little contribution to group),25% deduction from group mark.1.01 to 1.99 (demonstrated no contribution in several criteria or submits contribution passed agreed group deadline),50% deduction from group mark.1,no individual mark will be awarded.Detailed instructions and criteria can be found in the IBUS7302 Case/Topic Analysis Assignment Guide on Blackboard.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Criteria and Marking:Groups will be awarded a group score, and all members will share this same score which may be moderated by Peer Assessment results. There will be adequate out-of-class preparation time for the assignment.Marks will be allocated according to coverage of issues, the depth on analysis, professional presentation and evidence of research.A detailed information of the marking criteria is provided in the Case/Topic Analysis Assignment Guide on Blackboard.Not submitting the individual contribution materials will exclude you from receiving the group’s mark, since it implies you made no contribution(s) to the group assignment. Due dates apply.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
