The task for this assignment is to create a photo essay describing an innovation. It will consist of photos to be presented to the class on the due date. It is a 10-minute presentation with 5 minutes Q&amp;A. You must upload your presentation slides to Blackboard before the commencement of class. The photo essay should be structured as follows:</p>\n<p>Part 1: Take a picture of an innovation that is not a product or a service (see the notes from Lecture 1 for examples of other forms of innovation). In the presentation, briefly describe the innovation, what is innovative about it, and its importance.</p>\n<p>Part 2: Take 3-5 pictures of other parts of the economy or enabling technology that had to be in place to support this innovation. These are meant to be things without which the innovation you are looking at could not exist. In the presentation describe the roles these things play in supporting your focal innovation.</p>\n<p>Part 3: Take 2-4 pictures that show who or what benefits from this innovation. The presentation describes the benefits (pain relievers and gain creators) they derive from the innovation.</p>\n<p>Part 4: Take 2-4 pictures of other parts of the economy that are potentially disrupted or threatened by this innovation. In the presentation describe the threat that your focal innovation poses to these things.</p>\n<p>Ideally, I would like you to take as many of the photos as possible yourself. One of the points of this assignment is to make some of these ideas about innovations more tangible, and figuring out how to take a good picture of something that is not a product is a good way to do this. However, if you do not have access to a camera or a camera phone, you can grab pictures from the internet. You can also do this for things that are just impossible to photograph. I’m not too worried about the quality of the photos, as long as I can tell what they are and how they fit into your story.</p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The Back Bay battery simulation is about transitioning to a new business from an old business. Even though this is a product example, it applies equally well to any business bringing Horizon 2 innovations into the core. In the essay, please address the following sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describe your experience with the simulation. What was difficult about it?</li>\n<li>How did the simulation reflect innovation themes that we have discussed in class? (e.g. Referring to the Christensen article on disruptive innovations, what does this simulation tell you about managing a disruptive innovation? What can we learn about avoiding the traps of moving a Horizon 2 business into Horizon 1 (See: Moore, Geoffrey A. \"To succeed in the long-term, focus on the middle-term.” <em>Harvard Business Review</em> 85.7-8 (2006): 84-90.))</li>\n<li>Considering your comments in parts one and two, what did the simulation teach you about managing changing technologies of production and delivery in your current or former employer’s market?</li>\n<li>Please make any suggestions on how the lecturer can improve the simulation experience. What did you value most in this course and please also make three suggestions on how the course could be improved.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The essay must be written in proper academic format, using APA referencing style. You are to reflect on your personal business experience and make reference to the current literature on your chosen innovation themes. You will be assessed for your ability to analyse, synthesise and evaluate your experiences against the literature and the simulation. A descriptive approach will not be acceptable. The name of this simulation is Back Bay Battery. The process is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You will be able to play an introductory and advanced scenario of the simulation as part of your assessment. Use both rounds wisely to ensure you understand the outcomes of your decisions and that you can use this learning in your reflective essay.</li>\n<li>You will be allowed to play the simulation after class. I will adjust the settings of the simulation at the advanced scenario stage, so the idea is to understand the principles, rather than memorising anything.</li>\n<li>Afterwards, you will be required to complete the reflective essay on the simulation (as set out above).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Access to your Harvard Business account for the simulation will be provided to you on Blackboard in when the simulation opens.</p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
