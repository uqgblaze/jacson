Students can choose which chapters they want to complete and submit. Multiple attempts per chapter are allowed.Students will be awarded 4 points upon completing one chapter (provided more than 80% of the questions have been answered correctly). A maximum of 20 points for this assessment in the final grade is awarded if students complete at least five chapters throughout the semester.A test bank, consisting of practical questions that integrate economic concepts and tourism issues, is adopted to assist students with self-practice and self-learning. It includes (1) basic questions that allow students to better comprehend the theory and concepts, and (2) advanced applied questions that discuss the impacts of COVID-19, sustainability, and global mega trends on tourism, businesses, and policies.Students need to engage with the test bank weekly, starting from week 2 to week 10. Each weekly test bank, consisting of 10 multiple-choice questions and two to three open-ended questions, is designed to align with the lecture taught that week. This allows students to review the concepts and test their knowledge by working with the questions. Correct answers will be provided once students submit theirs.AI StatementThis assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
