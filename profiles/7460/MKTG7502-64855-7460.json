This is a team project with 4-5 students per group. In teams, students will research brand evidence, conduct a focus group with students in their tutorial as participants, analyse the focus group data and prepare a multimodal (PowerPoint) presentation of their findings with strategic recommendations for their chosen brand, which all team members will present during a live oral presentation during tutorials to their tutorial classmates and tutor. Students will analyse the current brand strategy and make recommendations for brand strategy planning.</p>\n<p>Detailed project guidelines will be available on Blackboard. Student teams will present their completed brand strategy audit in class time during their allocated weeks during tutorial 10 (week 11) and tutorial 11 (week 12). Tutorial 12 will be used <strong>only</strong> for groups that missed their presentation in tutorials 10 and 11 (week 11 and 12).</p>\n<p><strong>Peer Assessment.</strong> It is important that groups work well together and that everyone does their fair share of the work. This course uses the UQ Group Peer Assessment tool called Buddycheck. All students must complete Buddycheck on Blackboard.  If the peer assessment result indicates that a team member has not been doing their fair share of the work, their <em>marks may be adjusted downward</em> based on peer assessment results. Peer assessment forms are due by the end of the day after your project presentation. To facilitate a shared understanding about how the team will function, team members should agree on a team charter for how the team will operate (a model team charter will be provided as a starter for your team). If your group is having problems, see your tutor as early as possible. If you fear that your team may assess you unfairly, it is important to discuss this with your tutor well before the project is finished. </p>\n<p>For help with how to effectively function in teams by building teams and managing team conflict see the online edX course “Working in Teams: A Practical Guide” <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/working-in-teams-a-practical-guide\">www.edx.org/course/working-in-teams-a-practical-guide</a> (link on the Blackboard website).  </p>\n<p><strong><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
