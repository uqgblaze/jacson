The respondents for the survey can be real world consumers outside the class in order to achieve greater variety in responses and real world insights to your new product/service concept.Your group will analyse survey data and report your observations/recommendations on the feasibility of the new concept to take it to the next stage of the new product/service development process. The survey will adhere to the ethical requirements for such studies stipulated by the University of Queensland. You must address specific instructions for each stage of the testing process that will be provided on Blackboard.Your report will be a videographic presentation of the final report.Your group will be provided with detailed guidelines about this assessment during early weeks of the semester. Failure to submit this assessment by the due date will result in late penalties being applied.Important information:1. This assessment will challengeyour groups' collective creativity. It will also be a great opportunity to apply your technology knowledge to solve an important consumer problem that will create added value to them.In that spirit, you are advised, not try to copy the concepts that have been developed by students in previous years. We are keeping a registry of previous years' product/service.2. Changes to groups and to your chosen product concept after the oral presentation are not desirable as such will hinder the progress of your project. In such event express written permission must be soughtandobtained from the course coordinator. Do not assume that you can change your product concept or group without obtaining permission.It is your responsibility to inform the course coordinator if there are any group difficulties and to seek alternative group membership.Peer assessment:For this assessment, all student groups must undertake a peer assessment as per specified form. This form will be provided on Blackboard. All completed forms must be attached to the assessment submission as an Appendix.In the event a group is in dispute on the individual contribution of group members for the submission of this assessment by the specified date as per submission guide, marks will be apportioned based on the peer assessment outcome.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
