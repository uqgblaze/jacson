Failure to submit this assessment by the due date will result in late penalties being applied.</p>\n<p>Important information:</p>\n<p>1. This assessment will challenge <strong>your groups' collective creativity</strong>. It will also be a great opportunity to apply your technology knowledge to solve an important consumer problem that will create added value to them.</p>\n<p>In that spirit, you are advised, not try to copy the concepts that have been developed by students in previous years. We are keeping a registry of previous years' product/service.</p>\n<p>2. Changes to groups and to your chosen product concept after the oral presentation are not desirable as such will hinder the progress of your project. In such event express written permission must be sought <em>and</em> obtained from the course coordinator. Do not assume that you can change your product concept or group without obtaining permission.</p>\n<p>It is your responsibility to inform the course coordinator if there are any group difficulties and to seek alternative group membership.</p>\n<p><strong>Peer assessment:</strong> For this assessment, all student groups must undertake a peer assessment as per specified form.
