Feedback on the correct approach will be provided in tutorials after each milestone to assist with learning key techniques, with the assignment grade provided after all components have been submitted.Further details about this project will be discussed in class and posted to our course Blackboard site.This project, being a team project, will use Group Peer Assessment to ensure all team members have contributed well to the team.All team members will evaluate their fellow team members, and this peer evaluation process may affect an individual's mark (ie, it may be that not all team members receive the same mark). Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to incorporate mechanisms that capture evidence about the team process, such as dates/agendas for meetings, fair/agreed allocation of duties, internal team timelines, etc.Your peer assessment outcome will moderate your total marks for this assignment.A detailed rubric for the project is accessible via Blackboard.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
