Students can select one of these five topics. Alternatively, students can propose a topic, which must be approved by teaching staff.The word limit for the essay is a maximum of 2,500 words.By way of clarification, this word count:includes headings and subheadings;does not include text in the header;does not include footnotes or Appendices - however footnotes should be used for citation purposes only.  Substantive text should not be included in footnotes.This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.Usage of AI is allowed in this assessment piece, but must be done within the indications and constraints indicated on Blackboard at the beginning of the course. These include including (typically in the assessment appendix) the prompts utilised to query AI, the responses provided by the AI, and evidence of critical analysis of text-generated AI, before usage in the assessment. Moreover, usage of AI needs to be adequately referenced in the assessment. These guidelines are provided because, to pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.A failure to use AI according to the guidelines above (and detailed on Blackboard at the beginning of the course) may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
