At the conclusion of these workshops, students will determine which of these case organisations represents their best work, and submit as follows for one of the case organisations:One PESTEL analysis of the general environment of the case organisation; andOne Porter's Five Forces analysis of the industry environment of the case organisation; andOne VRIN resources and capabilities analysis of the internal environment of the case organisationStudents will also be required to leverage this analysis in making a business-level strategy, corporate-level strategy, or strategic alliance strategy decision on behalf of the case organisation. They will provide further support for their decision by leveraging strategic theory taught in class. Details of the strategic choices associated with each case organisation will be outlined on Blackboard and in class.Work is to be completed in the templates provided on Blackboard.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

            "task_description": "Textbooks often portray strategy as a-political (without politics). However, this is a misleading impression. Organisations represent a complex environment, featuring a mix of actors with different motivations, levels of influence, and bases of power. These dynamics are most apparent during periods of organisational restructuring, where textbook models of best practice in organisational design are often rendered impossible by clashes between different actors motivated by competing interests. Students will be introduced to a hypothetical organisation, Millennium Airlines, which is restructuring to ensure its ongoing competitiveness in the face of challenging circumstances in its external and internal environment. Using information about the organisation and theory on organisational politics and structure, students will recommend a restructure which accounts for political realities of the organisation by completing:a zoom-style format (only) video brief to a member of the organisation's Executive which justifies their recommended structure; anda hierarchical diagram (only) of an ideal structure for the organisation; anda hierarchical diagram (only) of a recommended structure for the organisationPlease note:Video briefs must be in a face-to-face, zoom-style format. They are not to include images of Powerpoint slides. Videos containing images of Powerpoint slides will not be taken into consideration when marking this assignment.Any additional information (e.g. paragraphs and further explanations) submitted with the hierarchy diagrams will not be taken into consideration when marking this assignment.There is no need to submit a script to accompany your video.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
