Organisations represent a complex environment, featuring a mix of actors with different motivations, levels of influence, and bases of power. These dynamics are most apparent during periods of organisational restructuring, where textbook models of best practice in organisational design are often rendered impossible by clashes between different actors motivated by competing interests. Students will be introduced to a hypothetical organisation, Millennium Airlines, which is restructuring to ensure its ongoing competitiveness in the face of challenging circumstances in its external and internal environment. Using information about the organisation and theory on organisational politics and structure, students will recommend a restructure which accounts for political realities of the organisation by completing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a zoom-style format (only) video brief to a member of the organisation's Executive which justifies their recommended structure; and</li>\n<li>a hierarchical diagram (only) of an ideal structure for the organisation; and</li>\n<li>a hierarchical diagram (only) of a recommended structure for the organisation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Video briefs must be in a face-to-face, zoom-style format. They are not to include images of Powerpoint slides. Videos containing images of Powerpoint slides will not be taken into consideration when marking this assignment. </li>\n<li>Any additional information (e.g. paragraphs and further explanations) submitted with the hierarchy diagrams will not be taken into consideration when marking this assignment. </li>\n<li>There is no need to submit a script to accompany your video.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
