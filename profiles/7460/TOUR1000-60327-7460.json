In this assessment, you will assume the role of a <strong>destination manager of a regional destination</strong>; in this role, you work for a destination management organisation (DMO). As such, you are required to build and analyse a Tourism Plan for a target market segment.</p>\n<p>For this assessment, you will make use of an AI generator (such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, perplexity.ai or Google Bard) and general research. Your target segment and regional destination will be allocated in Tutorial Week 3.</p>\n<p>This assessment comprises two parts:</p>\n<p>1.      Tourism Plan. Using an AI generator, use the following prompt to build a Tourism Plan for your target market segment. Your plan must include a hospitality special experience (e.g., fine dining at a unique hospitality establishment) and/or an event. You are encouraged to refine and modify this prompt to generate a plan that is useful for your analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt: </strong><em>Create a 3-day tourism itinerary for [target segment] in [regional destination]. </em></p>\n<p>2.      Feasibility analysis. Research your regional destination and explain whether the generated Tourism Plan is <strong><em>feasible</em></strong> – that is, can this plan be carried out? This should be supported by information from the regional destination’s official website, as well as broader research using resources such as maps, flight information, reputable organisations’ websites, etc.</p>\n<p>Some of the questions you may need to consider in conducting a feasibility analysis: Do the suggested elements exist? Are the travel distances reasonable within the timeframe suggested? Does it provide sufficient specifics (e.g., names of attractions/restaurants) to be viable? If you used this plan, what other information would you need to make it a reality that is currently missing?</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>All references for this assessment should be in APA 7th referencing style, a guide for which is available in UQ Library (<a href=\"https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7\">https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7</a>).

All submissions should include a cover page, comprising your name, student ID number, the final prompt used for your assessment, the AI generator used, and your submission word count. Your word count is made up of <strong>Section 2 (feasibility analysis) </strong>of your submission; the plan itself will not be included in your word count, nor will it be considered in your Turnitin Similarity score. Turnitin Similarity scores should be kept below 20% (excluding results from the AI-generated plan).</p>\n<p>(<em>Note: This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students are encouraged to use AI technologies in Assessment 1a, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.

In the current worldwide tourism boom, your Destination Management Organisation (DMO) recognises an opportunity to drive economic growth, lead destination development, and welcome visitors to your region. You also realise that competition among regional destinations for visitors is high and you have limited organisational resources to develop your tourism product and market reach.</p>\n<p>Therefore, your DMO needs to convince key tourism government stakeholders (such as Tourism Australia, Tourism &amp; Events Queensland, Tourism VIC/NSW/NT, the relevant State Government, etc.) of the opportunities your region offers to your target segment. These government stakeholders need to see benefit in (a) directing resources to your region; and (b) aiding you in promoting your region’s destination advantages to potential visitors.</p>\n<p>Your task is to create a video pitch based on the same target segment, regional destination, and Improved Plan from Assessment 1b. This video should clearly identify:</p>\n<p>1.      Your understanding of destination competitiveness and the regional destination’s unique proposition(s), making use of the Destination Mix to highlight 3-6 unique propositions;</p>\n<p>2.      Your understanding of the target segment and its interests as it relates to your regional destination; and</p>\n<p>3.      The particular experience/s you offer to your target segment through your Improved Plan. </p>\n<p>You should include a closing statement to your audience (the tourism government stakeholder), specifying the resource(s) you are requesting from them to boost your reach into this target segment. You should also be very clear what the <strong>call to action</strong> is, and how this action will complement your regional destination’s readiness to welcome visitors.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This assignment requires you to create an <strong>8-minute video presentation recording</strong> as you would present it to the audience. You can use Microsoft Powerpoint, Canva or other presentation design aids to help you create a convincing and cohesive presentation. </p>\n<p>A sample template is available for general reference. Your submission must be in the form of a video that can be uploaded to Blackboard (commonly in the .mp4 format), showing your presentation and you delivering the presentation throughout. You may use Zoom for this recording (instructions: https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/it/learnuq-blackboard-help/learnuq-assessment/blackboard-assignments/recording-video-assignments-zoom). You may also use other recording methods, as long as they show your presentation and you delivering the presentation, and can be uploaded as a video.</p>\n<p>You will need to submit your video recording via the submission link on Blackboard.
