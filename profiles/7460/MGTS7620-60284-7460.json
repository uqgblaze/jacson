Failure to attend the presentation on the due date will incur a mark.Please note that the quality of the content is much more important than the delivery. However, a good presentation is a combination of reliable and clear content + professional communication. For this reason, I have allocated marks to both the content and presentation (see the marking rubric).A copy of your slides needs to be submitted via Blackboard, and before the seminar.Please make sure that you:Stick to the time limit (8 minutes per person. This may vary depending on the number of enrolments. You will be advised in advance if any changes were applied.)Limit the number of slides you use (I recommend no more than 6)Draw on quality reference materials and cite them on your slides. At least five journal articles (other than the suggested readings). Your reflection should show the benefit of having read intelligently in order to give you useful concepts and vocabulary.Focus on professional communication (eye contact, pace, projection, etc.)This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
