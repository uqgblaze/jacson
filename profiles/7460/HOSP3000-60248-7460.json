In doing so, you are trying to <strong>convince the audience</strong> that your client's position is the best one for everyone to follow. </li>\n<li>The audience will be comprised of various stakeholders, some of whom will be supporters of the development and others non-supporters. </li>\n<li>Also, the other clients will represent the audience (from the 'Prospective Clients' list above).  </li>\n<li>Therefore, it is important you understand the position of these other stakeholders and clients (are they likely to be supporters or non-supporters?) so that you can defend your own client’s position and persuade the audience that your client's position is the best to follow regarding the new casino development being part of Queen's Wharf IRD.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>PRESENTATION FORMAT</strong></p>\n<p>This assignment does not require a face-to-face presentation.

Please avoid making the file in a movie/video format, as it tends to create a file submission issue later.</p>\n<p>Given that people speak 100 - 150 words per minute, an overall script would aim to be within the range of 1,000 - 1,500 words.</p>\n<p><strong>GENERAL TIPS FOR PRESENTATION</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>List the related references (sources of information) on the final PowerPoint slide (however, do not 'speak' to this slide as part of your oral presentation - just show it).</li>\n<li>Make your presentation as informative and appealing as possible.</li>\n<li>Deliver the message that is critical but commonly overlooked. </li>\n<li>Use key points, words, phrases, and diagrams to engage your audience.</li>\n<li>Do not type sentences on PowerPoint - written material must be succinct</li>\n<li>Include a few high-quality graphics (eg, tables, diagrams, photographs, etc) – these make your slides more interesting and easier to follow text alone</li>\n<li>Avoid including movie/video clips or making your file in a movie/video format. Including movie clips or a video format will enlarge your file size and make submitting the file to Blackboard difficult. Please ensure that you receive and keep the submission confirmation email upon your submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>USE OF AI IN ASSESSMENT</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.

The ethical issue you identified may not necessarily be considered ethical by others. Thus, the key argument point of this assignment is to justify the ethical nature of the issue. This will require you a clear understanding of business ethics.</li>\n<li>Spend sufficient time conducting research on business ethics. References for business ethics must be from academic sources (i.e., academic journal articles). However, references for the business practices/examples can come from non-academic, reliable sources. </li>\n<li>If you submit the file after the due date, you are allowed to submit it ONCE. You cannot submit the file again after checking the similarity report if you submit the file AFTER the due date (due to the Turnitin setting).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use of AI in Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic, and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide limited support and guidance.
