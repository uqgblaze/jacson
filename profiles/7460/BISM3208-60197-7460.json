Each team will be assigned to an industry context. Your team’s task is toselect and describe anemergingtechnology,discuss how it might influence your assigned industry in years to come, andconsider what makes (or could make) this technology successful compared to other innovations.Starting in week 3, part of each seminar session will be devoted to the presentations of emerging transformative technologies by the respective teams.Requirements and format:Each team is asked to prepare a presentation of 10 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of facilitated in-class discussions/Q&A.All members of the team are asked to participate.How you manage this/allocate tasks is up to you to decide.The exact timing of your team's presentation depends on the industry assigned in week 1. NOTE: this project cannot be completed individually - it must be completed in a team. The team members must be officially signed on to the same group. You are expected todecide your team membership in week 1 latest,and to submit your list of 5 team members at that time online. Further instructions will be given in the first lecture. Please note: as a courtesy to others, if you decide to withdraw from the course, please inform your team. Teams should start with 5 members so that one member withdrawing will minimise the impact.Further details will be provided in class.AI StatementThis assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

This context will form the foundation for the second assignment.Task Description:The purpose of theindividualpresentation is for you to analyse a technology that can be consideredestablishedin your industry, i.e., it has become industry standard or best practice and has been in use for a long time (e.g., 10 years or longer). You will apply one of the theories discussed in weeks 2–4 to explore the impact of your chosen technology on businesses in your industry context. Your task is toa) select and describe anestablished technologythat has had a transformative impact on your industry in the past (‘what’),b) discusshowit influenced the industry, andc) critically analyse, using a (1) theory of your choice, what made (or did not make) this technology successful compared to other technical innovations at the time (‘why’).Once again, this analysis will require you to draw upon and apply one (1) of the theories previously discussed in class (during weeks 2–4), and to justify why the chosen theory is appropriate.Requirements and format:Each student is asked to prepare a presentation of 10 minutes (including PPT slides), and to record the presentation.Make sure you share your PPT slides on the screen. We recommend using PowerPoint, but you may also choose to use another presentation software, as long as visual content is provided. A presentation without visible slides will receive zero marks.The target length is 10 min but a variance of 5% (30 seconds) is acceptable: it is okay if your video is within 9:30 and 10:30 minutes. If you go under 9:30 min or over 10:30 min, you will be penalised by deducting 10% of the total possible marks for every minute or part thereof exceeding 10:30 min or falling short of 9:30 min. The presentation time will start once you start speaking.You must be visible during the entirety of the presentation (make sure your camera is on). If you are not visible, you will receive zero marks.Please note that the quality of the recording will not be assessed, hence no editing of the video file is required.We recommend you to set up a Zoom call with yourselves and use the file of the recording.Instructions on how to submit will be provided on Blackboard under Assessment folder.Plan your submission well ahead in case of any technical issues. Late submissions will be penalised by deducting 10% of the total possible marks for every calendar day or part thereof. Your submission needs to be in the system by the deadline time (i.e., you will be penalised for late submission even if you started the submission process before the deadline but managed to save it only after – do not leave submitting to the last minute!).AI StatementThis assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
