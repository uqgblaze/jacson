Each round presents a unique scenario that requires you to make business decisions aligned with the given circumstances. While the simulation runs based on teams' decisions, you (as a team member) need to come up with the \"best\" estimations (which deliver sustainable, profitable growth) to inform your team's decision-making process.</p>\n<p>While your primary goal is to maximise hotel profit, there will be many other areas that you need to consider. <strong>Prior to your team's weekly meeting during tutorial sessions</strong> to finalise group decisions, it is crucial for each individual member to complete each round as you will convene with your team. Each team member may then bring forth diverse decisions pertaining to different areas. Following these discussions, your team is required to suggest the \"optimum decisions\" for the current round before it closes. Each round stays open for a week before it is subsequently closed. In this simulation, there isn't a definitive correct answer; rather, a multitude of preferable answers exist.</p>\n<p>To complete this assessment, you, as an individual team member, must <strong>complete each round</strong> <strong>before</strong> the team's weekly meeting and <strong>take a screenshot of your decision checklist </strong>(instructions on how to locate it will be provided during the lecture). You will be requested to submit the screenshots of your decisions for the current round to Blackboard before the current round closes. Each round will remain open for a week after its launch - details of closing dates and related information will be explained in the lecture and the course Blackboard. Please be reminded that this assessment is irreversible once the round is closed. Each member is required to spend a minimum of 50 minutes on the simulation per round. Failing to do so will incur a 100% penalty for that round.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

It's mandatory for your team to elucidate the strategies implemented (e.g., causes) and how they contributed to these cumulative earnings (e.g., effects). Your team should scrutinise the scenarios (as seen in 'Outlook' in the situation) to validate the strategies employed in each round. Given that the decisions made in one round impact the performance in subsequent rounds, your team is expected to examine how these decisions influence cumulative earnings and other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) over time.</p>\n<p>Please consider this presentation scenario; a presentation to the Board Members of the parent company.

While your team is allowed to use different applications to create the presentation, it is your team's responsibility to ensure proper file submission, especially if it is not in PPTX format.</li>\n<li>Each team needs to submit a file via the course Blackboard site. Each team appoints a team representative to submit the file on behalf of all members. Only one submission per team is required; it is unnecessary for each member to submit the file. </li>\n<li><strong>Please check the submission history and confirm your assignment was successfully submitted.</strong> The teaching team will mark the file submitted to the system, regardless of whether it is incomplete or incorrect. Since the marks for this assignment will not be available to you/your team before the semester grade release date, it is essential to ensure that your team submits the correct file on time to avoid any unnecessary penalties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Peer Evaluation</strong></p>\n<p>A peer evaluation is required for this group assignment. Your mark will be moderated based on your individual contribution to the assessment task as indicated by your peers through a Peer Assessment tool. Individual grades will be calculated as the team score weighted by the peer evaluation score.</p>\n<p><strong>AI statement</strong></p>\n<p>Please be reminded that the use of any AI tools for completing this assignment is strictly prohibited.
