Informal, emergent leaders and wise influencers are increasingly valued and invited to speak at conferences, professional associations, businesses, and youth groups interested in improving society. As such, this is an opportunity to practice designing your path to becoming a wise influencer for your community and society.  </p>\n<p>As a group, you will work together to examine challenges or problems in your community (the university; your home community; Brisbane area). You will decide on a specific challenge and design an initiative to address or solve the problem. You will create a proposal to share with your classmates, and present your plan during class (presentation dates randomised; all presentations in second half of semester).</p>\n<p>Note that your individual grades for this assignment will be calculated partly from your group members' peer review scores on the quality of your contribution to the teamwork (e.g., ideas, organisation, emergent leadership). We work together in class on your group assignments, therefore attendance in class will impact on your grades.</p>\n<p>Detailed instructions will be provided on Blackboard and in class; and the process will be explained and workshopped in class. </p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
