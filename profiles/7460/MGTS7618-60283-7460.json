This assignment is an opportunity to practice social entrepreneurship to create such a positive impact as informal, emergent leaders and wise influencers. Informal, emergent leaders and wise influencers are increasingly valued and invited to speak at conferences, professional associations, businesses, and youth groups interested in improving society. As such, this is an opportunity to practice designing your path to becoming a wise influencer for your community and society.As a group, you will work together to examine challenges or problems in your community (the university; your home community; Brisbane area). You will decide on a specific challenge and design an initiative to address or solve the problem. You will create a proposal to share with your classmates, and present your plan during class (presentation dates randomised; all presentations in second half of semester).Note that your individual grades for this assignment will be calculated partly from your group members' peer review scores on the quality of your contribution to the teamwork (e.g., ideas, organisation, emergent leadership). We work together in class on your group assignments, therefore attendance in class will impact on your grades.Detailed instructions will be provided on Blackboard and in class; and the process will be explained and workshopped in class.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

At the end of semester you will submit a 2,000-word report in which you plan your career as a wise leader.Based on each week's readings, you will examine your own strengths and development. Planning around how you would like to be remembered, you will create a game plan for how to become a wise leader. You will describe your strengths and areas for development, anticipate challenges that could lead you off-course, and plan for how you can overcome those hurdles.PART A: Mind maps and reflections on the readings. Submit before lecture each week. (20% of total grade)Each weekbefore class, you will complete and submit (on Blackboard) a 1-page Mind Map and Reflectionbased on the readings for that week. You will bring them to class for discussing them as personal growth areas.These Mind Maps will be attached as Appendix in your final assessment, and you will refer to them in your plan of development toward becoming a wise leader.Your weekly submissions will be checked and graded: There will be 11 weeks in total, but we build in room for error (e.g., if you are sick one week) by counting only your top 8 submissions (submit before lecture each week).We will instruct you on the process in the first two weeks of class, and will work with you each week to understand how to integrate your Mind Maps into your growth plan.PART B: Final Report, including mind maps attached as Appendix. Submit on Blackboard by the due date. (30% of total grade)2,000 words +/- 10%. Self-reflection and planning assignment. All instructions posted on Blackboard.Note:Express yourself clearly with appropriate academic writing, drawing on and citing references covered in the course in proper APA style.The grading rubric is available on Blackboard.
