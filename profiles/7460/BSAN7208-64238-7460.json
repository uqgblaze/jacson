In that context, the report is to present an investment recommendation supported by data analysis and data visualisation techniques. The assignment requires that the student use at least three public data sets (see https://unstats-undesa.opendata.arcgis.com/#catalog), taken together as a whole, related to the identified business context. These three or more data sets are then analysed in support of the development of an investment recommendation that addresses one or more SDGs. You should write the report from the perspective of a business or a government entity considering such an investment.</p>\n<p>The essay is to present an analysis and interpretation of the data using at least two different forms of data visualisation as identified in lectures. The essay is to provide a broad overview of the context of the problem, identify the sources of the data sets and their relevance to the analysis, present the analysis and interpret the results, and finally link the analysis to key supporting arguments for the investment recommendation made. You should state any assumptions you make about your analysis or recommendation.</p>\n<p>Key to success with this assessment task is succinct analysis and strong links between the data visualisation and the key supporting arguments for the recommendation. The discussion is to be supported by citing research that supports the context, analysis, interpretation, and key arguments made in support of the recommendation.</p>\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<p>This assessment task is an individual report that draws upon several data sets. Note that in this context, a data set is simply a ‘table’ of data. It might be a listing of invoices, or employees, or of visitor numbers. Students using a nominated open data set should use at least one other open data set not provided. The report is to present a management recommendation (or recommendations) supported by data analysis and data visualisation techniques.</p>\n<p>The assignment requires that the student acquire at least three data sets. These data sets, taken together as a whole, relate to the identified context and the associated SDG related problem. Therefore, at least two data sets are to be analysed in support of the development of a management recommendation.</p>\n<p>The report is to provide a broad overview of the context of the business, identify the sources of the data sets and their relevance to the analysis, present the analysis and interpret the results, and link the analysis to key supporting arguments for the recommendation made. The analysis is to support the development of a management recommendation for a course of action, in line with an evidence-based management culture.</p>\n<p>The report is to present an analysis and interpretation of the selected data using at least three different types of data visualisation. Furthermore, at least two data sets should be evident in two different types of data visualisations presented. For example, a geo-spatial representation might have two data sets represented in it and a trend line might be used to relate two data sets to each other over time.</p>\n<p>As part of this requirement, the report should refer to at least three (3) academic, quality, peer reviewed research papers that support the issues, analysis and recommendations outlined in the report.</p>\n<p>The report should identify the sources of the data used.</p>\n<p><strong>Generative AI statement:</strong></p>\n<p>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",

The aim is to demonstrate your understanding of the principles of the Grammar of Graphics to reproduce a visualisation idiom and create a new visualisation based on requirements. The two visualisations that you must reproduce can slightly differ from the ones you created with Tableau, but the resulting visualisation should be as close as possible to the original ones.</p>\n<p>For the new visualisation(s) that you will create with ggplot2, you need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe your use of ggplot2’s grammar of graphics (in terms of data, layer, scale, coordinate and facets)</li>\n<li>Explain how your design choices allow for efficient visualisation of the data you want to analyse (refer to guidelines and principles from Munzner, Bertin, Tufte etc…)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the second phase of this section, you will bring interactivity to your visualisations. Your interactive visualisations should demonstrate at least three interactions (see Heer and Shneiderman’s taxonomy) and show how they help data exploration and sense-making in the report. You are encouraged to use the interactive libraries covered in Module 3.4.</p>\n<p>In the third and last phase of this section, you will provide a short evaluation of your design. This evaluation should address issues such as quality of encodings, efficient use of data/ink ratio, and other considerations covered in Module 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: Report </strong></p>\n<p>Students will prepare a major report (maximum 8 pages) based on their design and evaluation of their data visualisations.
