The planning and feedback from Assessment Task 1 will be used by you to develop Assessment Task 2. Likewise, the planning and feedback from Assessment Task 2 will be used by you to develop Assessment Task 3. Therefore, it is important that you choose a topic, as per the criteria below, that is of interest to you.Assessment Task 1 – Research Proposal Part 1: Defining your topic areaDevelop your own research topic related to one aspect of either tourismORhospitalityOReventsANDits impact on the sustainability of the host economyORenvironmentORsociety/culture. Your topic cannot be related to service management, and it cannot be a case study.For this assessment, you will make use of anAI generator(such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, perplexity.ai or Google Bard) and general research.This assessment task comprises three (3) parts:define your general topic area using generative AI.fact-check the information generated by generative AI.reflect on what you have learnt.Part 1:You are required to complete thetemplateprovided under 'Assessment' on Blackboard. We will discuss how to complete the template in the seminars.The template requires you to:State thegeneral topic areathat you want to investigate. A choice of twelve (12) general topic areas is provided on Blackboard.Specify thesector/industryyou will approach your topic from (tourismORhospitalityORevents).Specify the aspect of thetriple bottom line (TBL)that you want to focus on (economyORenvironmentORsociety/culture).State yourresearch question: To what extent does [insert general topic area from 1. above] impact on the sustainability of the [insert TBL from 3. above]?Set the boundaries of your research by using generative AI/literature to inform your definition of your general topic area (1. from above).Using an AI generator, use the following prompt to define your general topic area.Prompt: Provide a definition of [insert your general topic area] using 3 peer-reviewed academic journal articles within 150 words. Include a reference list APA7 style.You MUST copy and paste the definition generated by AI into the research template.Part 2:a. Review the journal articles generated by AI to validate the originality and accuracy of the definition.b. If these AI-generated journal articles do not exist, you MUST source three (3) peer-reviewed journal articles to support and justify your definition.c. Providetwo(2)direct quotes fromeachjournal article to support and justify your definition. Direct quotes MUST be referenced according to APA7.d. Use the information from a, b, c (above) to develop your own referenced definition of your general topic area (150 words).Some of the questions you may need to consider while conducting this research: Do these journal articles exist? Do they support the definitions generated by AI? Do they provide sufficient details to define your general topic area?Part 3:You are required to write a 150-word reflection on using generative AI for this assessment task. Your reflection should include:advantages of using generative AI for this assessment task;disadvantages of using generative AI for this assessment task;how/ if you believe you should use generative AI for the remainder of your university studies, and why.Format:Font size 11 pointFont type - Calibri; Times New Roman; ArialLine spacing - 1.5 spacingReferencing: APA7Use of AI Technologies:This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Translation (MT) technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.Criteria & Marking:UQ Students: Please access the profile fromLearn.UQormySI-netto access marking criteria held in this profile.Submission:Submit your Research Proposal Part 1: Defining your topic area Template to the Turnitin submission link provided on Blackboard.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
