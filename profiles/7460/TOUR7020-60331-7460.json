Likewise, the planning and feedback from Assessment Task 2 will be used by you to develop Assessment Task 3. Therefore, it is important that you choose a topic, as per the criteria below, that is of interest to you</em>.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Task 1 – Research Proposal Part 1: Defining your topic area</strong></p>\n<p>Develop your own research topic related to one aspect of either tourism <strong>OR</strong> hospitality <strong>OR</strong> events <strong>AND</strong> its impact on the sustainability of the host economy <strong>OR</strong> environment <strong>OR</strong> society/culture. Your topic cannot be related to service management, and it cannot be a case study. </p>\n<p>For this assessment, you will make use of an <strong>AI generator</strong> (such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, perplexity.ai or Google Bard) and general research.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>This assessment task comprises three (3) parts:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>define your general topic area using generative AI.</li>\n<li>fact-check the information generated by generative AI.</li>\n<li>reflect on what you have learnt.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Part 1: </strong></p>\n<p>You are required to complete the <strong>template</strong> provided under 'Assessment' on Blackboard. We will discuss how to complete the template in the seminars.</p>\n<p><strong>The template requires you to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>State the <strong>general topic area</strong> that you want to investigate. A choice of twelve (12) general topic areas is provided on Blackboard.</li>\n<li>Specify the <strong>sector/industry</strong> you will approach your topic from (tourism <strong>OR</strong> hospitality <strong>OR</strong> events).</li>\n<li>Specify the aspect of the <strong>triple bottom line (TBL)</strong> that you want to focus on (economy <strong>OR</strong> environment <strong>OR</strong> society/culture).</li>\n<li>State your <strong>research question</strong>: To what extent does [insert general topic area from 1. above] impact on the sustainability of the [insert TBL from 3. above]? </li>\n<li>Set the boundaries of your research by using generative AI/literature to inform your definition of your general topic area (1. from above).</li>\n<li>Using an AI generator, use the following prompt to define your general topic area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prompt: Provide a definition of [insert your general topic area] using 3 peer-reviewed academic journal articles within 150 words. Include a reference list APA7 style.</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>You MUST copy and paste the definition generated by AI into the research template. </strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Part 2: </strong></p>\n<p>a. Review the journal articles generated by AI to validate the originality and accuracy of the definition.</p>\n<p>b. If these AI-generated journal articles do not exist, you MUST source three (3) peer-reviewed journal articles to support and justify your definition.</p>\n<p>c. Provide <strong>two </strong>(<strong>2)</strong> direct quotes from <strong>each</strong> journal article to support and justify your definition. Direct quotes MUST be referenced according to APA7.     </p>\n<p>d.
