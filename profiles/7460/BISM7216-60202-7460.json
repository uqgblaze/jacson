Your assignment mark may be moderated based on this feedback.Best approach is usually to identify and engage with your team early, and deliver good quality work that is fairly distributed across your team! Don't forget to give review time before submission!All team members will evaluate their fellow team members, and this peer evaluation process may affect an individual's mark (ie, it may be that not all team members receive the same mark). Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to incorporate mechanisms that capture evidence about the team process, such as dates/agendas for meetings, fair/agreed allocation of duties, internal team timelines, etc.Your peer assessment outcome will moderate your total marks for this assignment.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

This is an individual assessment. Academic integrity provisions will be applied. The allocation of marks will be clearly indicated on each question. The exam will cover all course materials.Further details will be discussed in class and posted to our course Blackboard website.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
