To do so, you <strong>will be provided with a template where you can insert your responses. </strong>There are 8 weeks requiring the completion of this task from Week 2 to Week 10, excluding Week 6 where students are submitting their group assessment. The 8 essays will count towards your final grade (5% each, a total of 40%). Students will have the opportunity to submit ONE make-up essay in Week 11 (due October 8th, 22:00)</p>\n<p>The responses to each week’s essay will be covered during the corresponding Seminar, for example, during the Seminar of Week 1 we will cover the contents needed to respond to the first response which is due before the lecture of Week 2. Consequently, during the seminars, students will be guided through the completion of their essays. Moreover, the concepts identified in the weekly essays should be incorporated in Assessment 3 (final report).</p>\n<p><strong>Reference wordcount:</strong></p>\n<p>The completion of each essay should take approximately 30 mins of work and require no more than one-page of writing to answer, around 500 words.</p>\n<p><strong>Essay template:</strong></p>\n<p>For example, you might be asked to read Melissa Schilling’s chapter on types of innovation, watch a video of Tim Harford discussing the history of the electric dynamo, and then;</p>\n<p>1.   Identify ONE concept from the reading (complete prior to each week’s class)</p>\n<p>2.   Develop ONE idea demonstrating the application of this concept to the corresponding case study (complete prior each week’s class).</p>\n<p>3.   Elaborate ONE short argument explaining your perspective on a specific question based on the seminar’s learnings and team discussion (reflections, observations, refinement of your responses).</p>\n<p><strong>Submission: </strong></p>\n<p>All assignments are to be electronically submitted through the Blackboard Assessment link (Turnitin) within the Assessments section (Assessment 2). This assessment provides regular low-stakes opportunities to get feedback on your comprehension of the course material as well as accrue marks that will contribute to 40% of your final grade. We will also be drawing on this work to drive our in-class discussions and you will be required to incorporate the learnings from these activities in your Assessment 3.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you use Artificial Intelligence (AI) for this assignment?</em></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>No. You will have opportunities to use AI in this course, but not for this particular assignment.
