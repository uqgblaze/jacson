The goal of the application is to track both the events attended by users and relationships between users and other users. The system is then able to use this data to effectively market recommended events to users based on the events their friends have attended. You will be required to write 10 SQL queries that answer higher-level questions about the data in this database. (Note: Your queries must compile using a MySQL DBMS). A sample database will be provided to help you test your queries.</p>\n<p>AI STATEMENT: Students are permitted to use any form of AI to any degree in completing this assignment.
