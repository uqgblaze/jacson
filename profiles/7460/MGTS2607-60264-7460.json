This is a compulsory activity to help you understand how to write in a critically reflective way. Descriptive, rather than reflective, writing will not earn you any marks so it's important you complete the practice activity.NOTE:It is the position of UQ thatthe use of AI and MT outputs without attribution, and contrary to any direction by teaching staff, is a form of plagiarism and constitutes academic misconduct.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

The first part will provide you with valuable feedback to ensure you are 'on the right track' and can continue on to complete the second part of this task, the critical review report.NOTE:It is the position of UQ thatthe use of AI and MT outputs without attribution, and contrary to any direction by teaching staff, is a form of plagiarism and constitutes academic misconduct.These assessment tasks evaluate students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.PART A - Report Plan - 10%Choose one (1) of the Workplace relations topics or issues, as outlined in any of the first ten lectures, that you would like to explore further.NOTE:You can choose any topic/issue from these ten weeks, even if the topic has yet to be discussed in class.Undertake a 'first sweep' review of the topic/issue, and select two recent articles that address this issue from opposing perspectives. (NOTE: If you are unsure about the suitability of your articles or chosen issue, please check with your tutor.)Prepare a brief plan for your report, outlining the topic/issue you are planning to critically review (maximum 1 page).In this plan, summarise the issue you are investigating, providing enough information for the reader to understand the situation/context and why the issue IS an issue.You must include full details of the two articles chosen for your critical review.You must use APA 7 referencing styleNOTE: This task will help with the completion of Part B.PART B - Report - 40%In relation to your chosen topic/issue, and with reference to the two articles offering opposing perspectives regarding the topic/issue, complete a critical review in the form of a report.In your report's introduction, summarise the underlying issue so that the reader understands the situation/context. (NOTE: Use the feedback you received in Part A to help complete this part of your report.)THEN, critically evaluate the substance of your chosen articles with regard to your chosen issue.FINALLY, present your own conclusions in relation to your critical evaluation.NOTE: Though the report is based on a minimum of two key articles, you are encouraged to read widely and, as appropriate, draw on other relevant literature to inform your thinking. You should use a minimum of 8 academic references to do this.You have a word limit of 2000 words (+/- 10%), (excluding references).NOTE:It's more challenging writing a 'tight' report with a restricted word limit, however this is exactly the type of situation you will find yourself in once you begin working in industry. Therefore, spend time reading and thinking about the most important aspects of the issue you are exploring, and focus your thoughts accordingly.You must use APA 7 referencing styleWhen you submit your work, include a cover page (name, student ID, course code/name, report title, and the number of words in your report) plus a bibliography showing all sources of information using APA 7 referencing style.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
