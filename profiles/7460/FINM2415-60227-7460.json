You will be asked to estimate the firm's cost of capital, analyse its capital structure, and do corporate valuation. </li>\n<li>You are required to do this assignment in a group of 4 to 5 people. Group members do not need to be registered in the same lecture or tutorial. </li>\n<li>GROUP REGISTRATION: Each group must complete your group registration via Blackboard before starting the assignment. Group registration must be completed by <strong>5PM</strong> <strong>Friday 16th August 2024 (Week 4)</strong>. You should use the Discussion Board on Blackboard to look for group members. If you still have trouble forming your team, please let the teaching staff know as soon as possible. The assignment questions will be made available on Blackboard. </li>\n<li>PEER ASSESSMENT: Peer Assessment will be used to compute your final individual grade on the Group Assignment. Completing the Peer Assessment is mandatory. If you do not submit a Peer Assessment Form, you will receive a score of zero on the assignment. Peer Assessment will be completed on Blackboard, and is integrated into the Blackboard teams. Each team member will allocate 100 points between the members of their team. Justification of your distribution of points is essential if they are to be included in calculation of the final Peer Assessment Factor (PAF). In particular, if the score given to any team member deviates from the average by 10% or more, you must include a written justification. For example, in a team of 4, the average score will be 25. If you give someone 20 out of 25, you are saying that team member only deserves 80% (20/25) of the score on the team project. If everyone on the team gives the same score, then that team member will have a PAF of 0.8 and their project score will be 0.8 times the team score on the team assignment. Therefore, in a team of 4, all scores of 22.5 (27.5) and lower (higher) MUST be justified to count.</li>\n<li>The assignment is due at <strong>14:00 on 4th October 2024 (Week 10)</strong>. Peer Assessment for the assignment is due at <strong>17:00 on Friday 4th October 2024 (Week 10)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
