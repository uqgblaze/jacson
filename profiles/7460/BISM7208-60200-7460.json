Each team will be assigned to an industry context. Your team’s task is toselect and describe anemergingtechnology,to discuss how it might influence your assigned industry in years to come, andto consider what makes (or could make) this technology successful compared to other innovations.Starting in week 3, part of each seminar session will be devoted to the presentations of emerging transformative technologies by the respective teams.REQUIREMENTS AND FORMAT:Each team is asked to prepare a presentation of 10 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of facilitated in-class discussions/Q&A.All members of the team are asked to participate.The exact timing of your team's presentation depends on the industry assigned in week 1. NOTE: this project cannot be completed individually - it must be completed in a team. The team members must be officially signed on to the same group.

This context will also form the foundation for the individual assignment.Task Description:The purpose of theindividualpresentation is for you to analyse a technology that can be consideredestablishedin your industry, i.e., it has become industry standard or best practice and has been in use for a long time (e.g., 10 years or longer). You will apply one of the theories discussed in weeks 2–4 to explore the impact of your chosen technology on businesses in your industry context. Your task is toa) select and describe anestablished technologythat has had a transformative impact on your industry in the past (‘what’),b) discusshowit influenced the industry, andc) critically analyse, using a (1) theory of your choice, what made (or did not make) this technology successful compared to other technical innovations at the time (‘why’).Once again, this analysis will require you to draw upon and apply one (1) of the theories previously discussed in class (during weeks 2–4), and to justify why the chosen theory is appropriate.REQUIREMENTS AND FORMAT:Each student is asked to prepare a presentation of 10 minutes (including slides), and to record the presentation. In your presentation, you and your slides must be visible throughout.Make sure you share your slides on the screen. We recommend using PowerPoint, but you may also choose to use another presentation software, as long as visual content is provided. A presentation without visible slides will receive zero marks. You are NOT required to submit your slide deck.The target length is 10 min but a variance of 5% (30 seconds) is acceptable: it is okay if your video is within 9:30 and 10:30 minutes. If you go under 9:30 min or over 10:30 min, you will be penalised by deducting 10% of the total possible marks for every minute or part thereof exceeding 10:30 min or falling short of 9:30 min. The presentation time will start once you start speaking.You and your slides must be visible during the entirety of the presentation (make sure your camera is on). If you and/or your slides are not visible, you will receive zero marks.Please note that the quality of the recording will not be assessed, hence no editing of the video file is required.We recommend you to set up a Zoom call with yourselves and use the file of the recording.Instructions on how to submit will be provided on Blackboard under Assessment folder.Plan your submission well ahead in case of any technical issues. Late submissions will be penalised by deducting 10% of the total possible marks for every calendar day or part thereof. Your submission needs to be in the system by the deadline time (i.e., you will be penalised for late submission even if you started the submission process before the deadline but managed to save it only after – do not leave submitting to the last minute!).AI StatementThis assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The digital transformation hackathon itself will be guided by a theme and overall challenge, to be announced in class in week 8.Assignment 3 consists of two parts:- A 10-minute 'hackathon pitch' presentation, delivered in week 12 (worth 20%)- A 1000-word report demonstrating a synthesis of the 'pitch' presented (25%)Part 1: Hackathon PitchType:Team presentationDue Date:Week 12 in classThe purpose of this assignment is to build your ability to create and deliver a convincing narrative summarising the business model and value proposition for a digital technology to a general audience.Your presentation must demonstrate an in-depth understanding of who the intended customer is, how the value proposition addresses a need, and outline a well-developed solution, including a complete business model. The presentation also needs to cover an explanation of the process with which the team developed the business model, including the results of the data collected and analysed. All teams will present their final ‘pitches’ in week 12.Each team is asked to preparea presentation of 10 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of facilitated in-class discussions/Q&A. All members of the team are asked to participate.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.Part 2: Business Model ReportType:An in-depth report outlining the results of the ‘Digital Transformation Hackathon’Due Date:Week 13, Friday at 5:00 pm (AEST)The purpose of this assignment is to build your ability to create and deliver a narrative summarising the business model and value proposition for a new or emerging transformative technology to a managerial audience. You may think of the report as a document a start-up might submit to an investor seeking funding. The report must demonstrate an in-depth understanding of who the intended customer is, how the value proposition addresses a need, and outline a well-developed solution, including a complete business model canvas with all nine components. The report also needs to cover an explanation of the process with which the team developed the business model, including an overview and results of the data collected and analysed. Teams are also asked to include an analysis of potential competitors/competing technologies. You may draw on and use the theoretical lenses included in the course.Format:- Calibri or similar font, 12-point, 1.5 line-spacing, 1-inch margins all around (A4 paper). Minimum1000 words(with 5% upwards flexibility, total world limit 1050 words (not including references or appendices).- Report should be submitted online. One team one report. Information on how to submit the report will be provided in class.PEER EVALUATION:As this is a team project, peer evaluation is required in order to consider the contribution of individuals to all activities completed as this team.Your evaluation must be evidence-based. For example, the record of meetings and attendance is part of this evidence. These, coupled with the signed project plan, will contribute to the evidence.NOTE: any major issues must have been brought to the course coordinator’s attention well in advance of the submission of your peer evaluation, not a few days before or after the project is completed.Further details will be provided in class and on Blackboard.Generative AI Statement - For all parts of this assessment:This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
