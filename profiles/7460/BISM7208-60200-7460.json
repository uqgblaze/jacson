Each team will be assigned to an industry context.

This context will also form the foundation for the individual assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Task Description: </strong>The purpose of the <strong>individual</strong> presentation is for you to analyse a technology that can be considered <strong>established</strong> in your industry, i.e., it has become industry standard or best practice and has been in use for a long time (e.g., 10 years or longer). You will apply one of the theories discussed in weeks 2–4 to explore the impact of your chosen technology on businesses in your industry context. Your task is to</p>\n<p>a) select and describe an <em>established technology</em> that has had a transformative impact on your industry in the past (‘<em>what’</em>),</p>\n<p>b) discuss <em>how</em> it influenced the industry, and</p>\n<p>c) critically analyse, using a (1) theory of your choice, what made (or did not make) this technology successful compared to other technical innovations at the time (‘why’).</p>\n<p>Once again, this analysis will require you to draw upon and apply one (1) of the theories previously discussed in class (during weeks 2–4), and to justify why the chosen theory is appropriate. </p>\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS AND FORMAT:</strong></p>\n<p>Each student is asked to prepare a presentation of 10 minutes (including slides), and to record the presentation.

The presentation time will start once you start speaking.</li>\n<li>You and your slides must be visible during the entirety of the presentation (make sure your camera is on). If you and/or your slides are not visible, you will receive zero marks.</li>\n<li>Please note that the quality of the recording will not be assessed, hence no editing of the video file is required.</li>\n<li>We recommend you to set up a Zoom call with yourselves and use the file of the recording.</li>\n<li>Instructions on how to submit will be provided on Blackboard under Assessment folder.</li>\n<li>Plan your submission well ahead in case of any technical issues. Late submissions will be penalised by deducting 10% of the total possible marks for every calendar day or part thereof. Your submission needs to be in the system by the deadline time (i.e., you will be penalised for late submission even if you started the submission process before the deadline but managed to save it only after – do not leave submitting to the last minute!).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
