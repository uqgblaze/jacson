The prototype will help you test initial ideas and gather feedback from project supervisors and teaching team early in the development process.The prototype must be accompanied by a written report that explains how the prototype addresses the project’s business problem, how it meets the requirements, and why the proposed interface helps users make data-driven decisions from the business data.Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI in completing this assessment task; however, students must clearly reference any use of AI in each instance.

You should do this by communicating effectively; that is, using concise, fluent and persuasive language, and structuring the presentation in a way that keeps the audience engaged. The final part of the assessment integrates a Q&A segment, when your industry partner will ask you questions and provide feedback. This provides a great opportunity to gather valuable feedback from them, which can be incorporated in the final industry report.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
