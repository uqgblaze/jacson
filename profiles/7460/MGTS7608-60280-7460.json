This is not an open-book exam. You will need to answer the questions using information based on your weekly readings. A good essay will not be based on your opinions as it must include a demonstrated understanding of stakeholder theory, and be based on evidence using examples from the course case studies to support your arguments. A good essay answer will be between 300-500 words long. You must use prose style with well structured sentences and paragraphs. Dot points will not be acceptable. You do not need to provide references but you will need to write using English academic language that is concise and clear for your marker to understand. </p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
