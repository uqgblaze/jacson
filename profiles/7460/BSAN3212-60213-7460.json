This should include the tools and techniques you used, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.3.   Results: Present the results of your work, including any graphs, charts, or other visualisations that help to convey your findings. Explain how your results contribute to a better understanding of the project goals and deep learning in general.4.   Future projects: Reflect on your experience completing the tasks, including what you learned and how you might apply that knowledge in the future. Consider any limitations or caveats to your work and how they might impact the conclusions you drew. Summarise the key takeaways from completing the projects and speculate on how the methodologies could be applied to an important business problem.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In a 3000-word project proposal, you should aim to address a significant business challenge or opportunity within a specific industry or field that can be tackled using deep learning methods.Your project proposal should include the following sections:Introduction: Provide a brief overview of the challenge or opportunity you will be addressing with your proposed project. Explain why this challenge or opportunity is significant and why deep learning methods are well-suited to address it.Project Objectives: Define the specific objectives of your project. This should include a clear statement of the problem you will be addressing and the goals you hope to achieve with your deep learning solution.Methodology: Describe the deep learning methods you will use to achieve your project objectives. This should include a clear explanation of the algorithms, models, and techniques you will be employing and any data sources you will be using.Evaluation: Define the evaluation metrics you will use to assess the effectiveness of your deep learning solution. This should include both quantitative and qualitative metrics, as appropriate.Timeline: Provide a detailed timeline for completing your proposed project. This should include specific milestones and deadlines for each phase of the project and any potential roadblocks or challenges you anticipate.Conclusion: Summarise your project proposal, including its objectives, methodology, evaluation metrics, and timeline. Discuss the potential impact of your proposed project and how it may contribute to the broader field of deep learning.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
