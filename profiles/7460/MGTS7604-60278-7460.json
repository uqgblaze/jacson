Topics covered: 3 sample questions revolving around Chapter 1 and 2 content. Duration: 15 minutes. NB. This trial exam does not count towards your final mark. It is a trial, to ensure everyone is familiar with the interface and work through any technological challenges ahead of the exam in Week 8.Mid-Semester Exam - Scheduled for September 12 (in Week 8). Topics covered: 25 questions on Chapter 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Duration: 45 minutes.Alternative Mid-Semester Exam - Students who are unable to attend and/or unable to log into the mid-semester exam in Week 8, due to any circumstance, are automatically eligible for the alternative mid-semester exam. The mark achieved on this exam will replace the mark of the missed quiz (which, by default, is zero). This exam is not to be taken by those who have already completed the exam in Week 8 and are not satisfied with their mark. As such, it does not override a previously achieved mark. The alternative exam is scheduled for September 19 (in Week 9) and also covers 25 questions across Chapter 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The questions are different to the Week 8 exams, albeit with the same degree of difficulty. If this date presents a conflict for you, contact the course coordinator at your earliest convenience.Latearrivals:Beginning either exam late does not make students eligible for an alternative quiz. Once you log in, you must complete the quiz. Make the most of the time you have left.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
