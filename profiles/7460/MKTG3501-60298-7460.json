This project will require practical activity throughout the semester and will involve the development of a persuasive presentation. A full description of this major assessment item will be provided by the course coordinator and will be available via Learn.UQ. The presentation should be persuasive, concise and clearly argued, professionally articulating your strategic recommendations. Scholarly, as well as industry and company evidence will be integral to performance. APA Referencing is suitable, included as the last slide in the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Team work</strong></p>\n<p>Teams will be formed within tutorials, so students can only form groups with others enrolled in their tutorial. Students who enrol late or do not engage with their team early in the course, may be required to complete the task as an individual, or in a smaller team that may formed of remaining students. </p>\n<p>Team work is a valuable and important component of this program. Students should be aware that in normal circumstances, all members of the team will receive the same mark for the project, unless individual group issues are formally lodged. A team contract will be submitted and peer evaluation will be undertaken by all teams and will be considered in conjunction with the team contract and group records. Group contributions should be monitored weekly and proactive issues management should be implemented. Often issues are managed through clear communications and can be resolved for positive team outcomes. As such, all group issues should be proactively addressed via discussion or email with your class tutor. It is essential that teams attempt to resolve issues during the project. However, individuals who are shown to not perform to the group standard will be penalized, having marks deducted to a standard which reflects the evidence, which may include receiving zero marks where warranted. In such situations, all individuals are responsible for keeping evidence of their contributions to the group.</p>\n<p><strong>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
