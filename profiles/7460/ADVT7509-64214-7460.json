            "task_description": "Creativity is the soul of advertising. Without the creative execution – no one will pay attention to the message and clients will not successfully sell their products or services. A creative strategy defines the important strategic choices required to develop and effectively deliver a targeted message to the desired consumer segment. The creative strategy defines what you will say about your product or service and addresses how you want consumers to think about your brand. Developing an effective advertising campaign involves design of a strong message strategy, with impactful advertising appeals and execution style.In this assessment, you are required to select an existing advertising campaign*for a product/service and critically dissect the elements of the campaign, including the message strategy and execution style. Students will be provided with a structure for their creative strategy analysis.*Note: content in the advertisement must all be in English and the product/brand needs to be familiar to the teaching staff. In addition, the campaign needs to have been in the market from present time to past 2-3 years only.Your critical analysis of the advertising campaign will be supported by insights gained from secondary research and connections to creative strategy theory. You are also required to address whether you felt the campaign was/was not effective (and why) in achieving advertising campaign objectives and present recommendations as to how the creative strategy and execution could have been improved for greater effectiveness.This is an individual assessment and as such, students should not work with/collaborate with other students in the cohort when working on this written report. A step-by-step assessment brief including full details of the individual report will be located in the assessment folder on the unit’s Blackboard site. Please refer to this guide for full details of this individual report. The skills acquired from this creative strategy analysis will be built on in the following two assessment items.The Creative Strategy Analysis report word count is 1,500 words (10% over/under allowable). Reference list and appendices are not included in the word count. All submissions must be written in English.Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI in completing this assessment task..
