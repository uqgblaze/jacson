This could be for reasons such as a changing market; need for refurbishment; change in venue; or growth/decline. It is important to justify why this experience needs to be redesigned, not simply list numerous superficial reasons why it should be redesigned. The redesign does not need to be major or revolutionary. It might be to focus more on a specific market, or the need for a new site management procedure, or an updated promotion.</p>\n<p>The redesign should be feasible and relevant to both the experience provider and the potential visitors. Using segmentation techniques, students will identify and profile relevant market segments that will be targeted with the redesign. Consideration will also be given as to why these segments would be motivated to experience the redesigned experience. If the segments do not match the redesign, the appraisal is meaningless.</p>\n<p>Further information will be provided on Blackboard and in Tutorials.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Sections of the report will follow the core concepts covered in the course and should contain the sections outlined below.</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>This section should introduce the existing experience and include an overview of the redesigned concept. Information such as the name, description and location of the experience would be appropriate in this section. You should include a few points justifying why the experience needs to be redesigned. You should briefly summarise your target market segment from your appraisal.</p>\n<p><strong>Orchestra Model</strong> (current) You are to first apply Pearce’s (2011) model to your visitor experience redesign. The orchestra model of tourism experience is very important as it provides the theory that will guide your further changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Orchestra Model</strong> (redesign) Then consider how one or two of these areas of the model can be improved through your experience redesign. Note: You don’t need to change the world, focus on one or two components of the orchestra model that can be considered to redesign your experience. Remember to consider your target market.</p>\n<p><strong>Experiencescape</strong> Here you should justify the changing visitor settings and orientation including intangible elements (see Bitner, 1992) servicescape- (ambient conditions, spatial layout).</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor Management </strong>You should consider the management of queues, crowding and capacity issues that may arise. In addition, what steps will you take to ensure that employees are well positioned to provide high quality visitor experiences? </p>\n<p><strong>Interpretation </strong>How will you design and manage the experiential aspects to ensure that visitors have a memorable time? What orientation aids can be used to assist visitors with navigation and time management? </p>\n<p><strong>Post-Experience Outcomes</strong> You should also describe how you will monitor and improve experience quality and visitor satisfaction. What will you do to encourage repeat business or to develop an ongoing relationship with visitors? How will you help visitors create, share and recall positive memories of their experiences?</p>\n<p><strong>Infographic </strong>is a visual representation of an idea, and yours should be succinct and eye-catching. These tend to be increasingly used by businesses in tourism, events and hospitality when selling an idea to potential investors. Your infographic needs to be specific and focused and provide a visual summary of your redesign. You should incorporate informative text and engaging images or graphics to appeal and explain your ideas.</p>\n<p>Further information will be provided on Blackboard and in Tutorials.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
