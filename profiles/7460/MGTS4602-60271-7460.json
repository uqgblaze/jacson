Topics should be selected that are: (1) topical; (2) reflect some of the criteria of a “wicked problem”; (3) it will be possible to find academic research articles or industry (grey) reports about the issue, or ideas that help explain the issue at least in a search of the text book, the UQ library or Google search; and (4) the topic opens itself to the application of all of the four frames.</p>\n<p>Special attention by each member of the group should be given to the incorporation of the academic and grey literature to support key points, and evidence that the frames was applied by each group member in a convincing way to the topic. Smooth transitions between speakers and frames is expected, as well as presenting in the time frame allocated of 15 minutes plus 3-5 minutes of questions.</p>\n<p>There will be a maximum of 12 PowerPoint slides used in the presentation (plus not part of the 12 slides maximum, 2 extra slides, one introductory slide that gives the topic name and team members’ names; and 1-2 slides of all of the references used in preparing the presentation).</p>\n<p>Each of the 6 team members will present as the assessment will be based on the slides and<strong> </strong>each individual's component of the presentation.

In so doing, identify which frame(s) were dominant. Support your analysis and demonstrate your insight into your issue by integrating relevant academic literature, ideally peer reviewed quality journal articles. This is a critical criterion. Consider how you can support your claims and key points by using this quality academic research.</li>\n<li>3.0 Recommendations - Draw on your knowledge of the frames used to make specific recommendations for how the issue or problem could have been more effectively addressed or resolved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Format for the report: Abstracts/executive summaries are not required and should not be included.</li>\n<li>Use a standard referencing system, to provide a totally accurate and complete list of all references used in compiling the report.

It is these analytical skills around change that will be an asset to you initially in your career, either in analysing your own emerging roles and your changing organisation, or those of a client.</p>\n<p>This is an ideal time to reflect on, and to critically analyse, a change event that involved a change to an organisation, a community or to a society. Your task is to provide a consultancy report to the organisation, community body or to society more generally that (1) initially describes what this change was around its degree of complexity and timing; (2) how well this change was managed and lead or not across a number of key stages or major issues that are typically identified in the academic literature in numerous change management models or frameworks; and (3) finally as a consultant you will provide a list of recommendations that follow on from this detailed critical analysis based on this academic analysis.</p>\n<p>You may have been a leader or recipient of this change that will guide this choice of a change event. Or more likely in your choice of topic, this change event is well-known publicly, and there is an academic and related literature that can be used to provide, and assist you, with an in-depth and critical analysis. Your sources of data that will guide your analysis of the change must include the major use of the large body of academic research published in reputable journals as articles, as book chapters, quality books and web pages; available case study materials that might include reports about the change published as case studies, in government reports, and to a lesser degree as newspaper reports; and if feasible, but not essential, a small set of interviews (3-5 maximum) with those individuals who either designed and lead the change, and/or were recipients of the change.</p>\n<p>In sum, you will need to read scholarly articles from quality sources to ascertain not only the effectiveness according to theory/models of best practice of the change process that was implemented, but also to then work from this analysis to provide a number (5-10 maximum) of recommendations about how this change might have been even more effectively planned and executed.</p>\n<p>This Change Management Analysis assignment might be structured in the four parts as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Part One: Description and contextualisation of the change </strong></p>\n<p>This section of the report provides the reader with some insight into the topic of the change, including what it is (organisation, community, broader societal change); and the complexity and challenges involved. Let the reader know here the single change management model and its core principles about change (5-10 maximum) that you will apply to examine this change event, while it is also acceptable to apply from several change models a set of change management principles (5-10 maximum) that will guide your analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Two: Analysis and evaluation of the change issue </strong></p>\n<p>Then the report will provide the core part of the evaluation, based on a guiding model(s) and their guiding principles about change, with supporting analysis of the key issues or change stages, with major use of the academic literature to evaluate the evidence about the importance or not of the application of those change principles. So, across several sub-headings the report will provide a sound structure that moves into providing a detailed and critical analysis of the complexity of the challenges faced in making this change; using the variety of sources as detailed above under the Task Description to critique what was done; and with each sub heading or issue that has been analysed, providing the logic or case that supports the recommendations that will follow in the next section.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Three: Recommendations</strong></p>\n<p>In this section: the report provides firstly a brief overview section on “what was done well” and so does not require much improvement if this organisation, community group or similar was to make such changes in the future. The key part on this section, however, is the set of Recommendations about how to improve this change event or similar change events based on the critical analysis and academic literature that is presented. As noted above, these Recommendations should not “be a surprise” to the reader, as they will logically flow from the evidence and analysis in the prior sub-sections in the report.   </p>\n<p><strong>Part Four: References</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Also consider the following:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Format for the report: Abstracts/executive summaries are not required and should not be included.</li>\n<li>Use a standard referencing system, to provide a totally accurate and complete list of all references used in compiling the report. The reference list is not included in the word count.</li>\n<li>Assignments exceeding the word limit by more than 10% will be penalised in line with UQ policy. </li>\n<li>You can assume complete confidentiality: The report is for educational purposes only and will be treated as confidential. </li>\n<li>Marking will follow the rubric provided on the course Blackboard site. Look again at the rubric as you prepare the report.</li>\n<li>A word count must be provided on the cover page with your name and student number.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.</strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
