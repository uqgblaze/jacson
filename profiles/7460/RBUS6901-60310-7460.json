The following characteristics of the case findings write up are expected: Case context, Essential research question, how your findings answer the question, conclusions about the findings. Your presentation from Assessment 1 should be included as an appendix, with a brief note on how well your research design allowed you to arrive at the findings or any changes you had to make. Further details about this task will be discussed in class and posted to our course Blackboard site.Marking criteriaThis assessment item gives you opportunity to write up qualitative findings, using qualitative data as a source of evidence for the claims you make about your case organisation. You can choose to write either a practitioner report for your organisation or to write your report up as the findings section for a qualitative academic paper. The main assessment criteria are:Briefly introduce your research context, setting out the Essential features necessary for a reader to understand the findings.Show the themes you have developed from your analysis and how these were developed from the dataDemonstrate a clear use of all sources of evidence and triangulation of data to make claims about the caseA summary with recommendations or conclusions. This might outlines either the theoretical or practical contributions your research makes to management studies.The report should be a minimum of 2,500 and a maximum of 4,000 words, excluding appendices and references.More specific criteria and assessment guidelines will be handed out in class, including any relevant details about peer assessment.AI Statement:This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).

The purpose of this assessment is to build a diary of reflections, which enable you relate the qualitative research approaches taken up in the course to your own research project, as follows:First, you should submit a reflective diary for each session of the course, in which you note your growing understanding and puzzles as you conduct qualitative research. These diaries should reflect on the choices made to select the qualitative research approach chosen as a team (basis of Assessment 1 and Assessment 2). Personal reflections after team discussions provide an additional basis for your diary entries.Second, you should develop a report, built from these diaries and your experience of assessments 1 and 2, that discusses how your experience in this course and reflection on qualitative research approaches can be applied to your own research.The report should be a minimum of 2,000 and a maximum of 3,000 words, excluding appendices and references. All diary submissions should be included in the appendix.Marking criteriaYou are required to submit a reflective diary after each session and after team discussions. It provides an additional basis for your reflection.You will be assessed on your ability to:Build a corpus of reflections over the diary entries throughout the courseProvide a reflection on the chosen research approach(es) which formed the basis of your team assignment; andPresent a report that is well argued, and which demonstrates a clear understanding of the discussed research approaches and their application to your own research.This assessment gives you opportunity to explore the possibility of using qualitative research approaches in your own research.More specific criteria and assessment guidelines will be handed out in class.AI Statement:This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
