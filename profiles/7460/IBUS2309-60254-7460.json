Assignments will be discussed in the seminars and tutorials.Students must follow the criteria found in the assignment guide provided on Blackboard or risk failing the assignment.This entire group assignment is worth 35% of your final mark. The assignment consists of multiple parts, all team members must participate in all aspects of the assignment. Individual in-tutorial quizzes worth 15% of your final mark are linked to the tutorial presentations.All aspects of this assignment relate to employability building skills.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.  This includes dictionary and translation APPs.Groups will randomly be created by the course coordinator/facilitator.Once the teams are created you must contact your group by the end of week 3 or risk failing the assignment and losing out on group marks.You are not allowed to change groups by yourself, the group changes deadline is week 3. All are in the same situation, so please take note of your presentation time and adjust your schedule accordingly.Students must submit all assessments to pass the course.Peer Evaluation:The purpose of this evaluation is to assess a member’s contribution to the group effort. Group members may contribute to the group along various dimensions. These include their organisation/project management, knowledge/research, communication, and responsibility, including supporting the group and members in any way. Use the 9-point rating scale given below to rate yourself and members of your group. Please be as objective as possible, taking behaviours rather than personal style into consideration.Peer reviews are compulsory to ensure that a contribution score is available for all moderation.Instructions:You are required to assess your peers on their contribution to the group assignment by allocating each group member a mark in each of the four criteria. For each criterion, allocate a mark between one and six, where a mark of one(1) indicatesno contributionor submitting contribution passed the agreed group deadline, and a mark ofnine (9) indicates that they made the maximum contribution possible.1 = Person demonstratedno contribution in this criterionor submitted contributions past the agreed-upon group deadline.1.01 – 1.99 = Person demonstrated a low contribution to the group in this criterion.2 – 3.99 = Person demonstrated a medium-low contribution to the group in this criterion.4 – 5.99 = Person demonstrated a medium-level contribution to the group in this criterion.6 – 8.4 = Person consistently demonstrated a medium-high level of contribution to the group in this criterion.8.5 - 9 = Person consistently demonstrated high-level contribution to the group in a criterion.A mark of six (6) or less (1 to 6), based on the above guide (out of 9) for any criteria, requires a comment; otherwise, it is invalid.To take account of the possibility that a student does not contribute to one or all criteria, 1 signifies that a student has not contributed.Peer reviews are compulsory and must be submitted within five days of the assessment due date,not submitting peer reviews may decrease marks.If no peer review is received from a student after 5 days, then no contribution scores are calculated and not available for all moderation. No exceptions!Important Mark Moderation Based on Peer Review – highest score is 9, see explanation below.The moderation of individual marks will be based on the following overall average review):8.5 to 9.0(consistently demonstrated full contribution to group),no deduction from group mark.8.0 to 8.4(demonstrated medium-high level contribution)5% deduction from group mark.6.0 to 7.99(demonstrated medium level contribution),15% deduction from group mark.3.0 to 5.99(demonstrated medium-low contribution),25% deduction from group mark.1.01 to 2.99(demonstrated low contribution in several criteria or submitted contribution passed agreed group deadline),50% deduction from group mark.1, no individual mark will be awarded.Criteria 1: Organisation/Project ManagementRole in contributing to the process needed to complete the assignment.Consider their approach to setting up meeting times and work submission deadlines as well as their willingness to listen to other group members' opinions.Criteria 2: Knowledge/researchContribution of research, knowledge, opinions, and skillsto group discussions and work completion.Maintaining academic integrity (ensuring original work; no plagiarised and/or AI-generated materials).Criteria 3: CommunicationHow well one collaborated and communicatedwith others in the group and fulfilled their roles within the group. To determine your mark, consider if each group member:was present at all meetings, as long as feasibly possible (either in person or via phone/online) (barring legitimate reasons),played an active role in facilitating agreement and resolving conflict and,provided timely responses to all communications and queries.Criteria 4: ResponsibilityTaking responsibility for the group’s outcome, and consistently acting in a manner that demonstrated they were keen for the group to perform well (e.g., supporting the group).This includes ensuring that the English language is used in all forms of communication. Since the official language of Australia is English, non-compliance can lead to assessments awarded the mark of zero, and non-compliance in group settings be interpreted as exclusionary behaviour, a form of bullying and a serious offence.Students must follow the criteria found in the assignment guide provided on Blackboard or risk failing the assignment.The week of the Oral Presentation will be assigned to each group early in Semester. Group Oral Presentation Slides due 1 week prior to presentation.Not submitting the individual contribution materials will exclude you from receiving the group’s mark, since it implies you made no contribution(s) to the group assignment.A hardcopy, handout of the presentation with reference list are to be handed to the marker(s) on the day of the presentation; all groups must be ready to present on the day of presentation with their presentation materials on a USB or alternative device to use the seminar room facilities.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ policy.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
