The three behaviours shall cover diverse industries rather than come from a single industry. A good starting point is to look at trends (or changes) in consumer decision-making process, consumption process, and post-consumption experiences during the past 10 to 20 years. Examples of potential topics or areas will be provided and discussed during class.(2)    Background information (e.g., an overview of the phenomenon).(3)    Explain or justify behaviour/effect/phenomenon (problem formulation/identification). Detailed guidelines will be provided in class.(3)    For each behaviour, clearly state the research aim.(4)    For each behaviour, formulate and spell out two research questions (i.e., a total of 6 research questions for the three behaviours in assessment 1).The main purpose of this proposal (Assessment 1) is for your group to receive feedback and suggestions from the teaching team on how to improve the topic, research aim, and research questions. You should incorporate the feedback into the independent research project report (Assessment 2).Peer Review:Group members are expected to contribute equally, fulfilling the tasks agreed on. If there are disagreements with team members' contributions that cannot be resolved, students must bring the problem to the attention of their Course Coordinator as early as possible. Students can elect to undertake a Peer Review process, which can influence the marks of those who do not contribute to group work.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
