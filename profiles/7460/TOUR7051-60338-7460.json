Assume that you are an external consultant and are presenting the case study findings for the destination to the DMO and the associated stakeholders.A Case Study analysis is an incredibly important technique that DMOs are required to consistently complete. This is a necessary component when marketing a destination to domestic and international tourists. It is also required when evaluating competitors and the internal and external environment. A case study will guide future marketing strategies. It also offers a current snapshot of where the DMO, destination and current stakeholders sit in relation to tourism development. More information on conducting a destination case study analysis will be explained in Week 6.The DMOYour DMO needs to responsible for marketing a specific city (e.g. Melbourne, Shanghai), region (e.g. Fraser Coast, Tropical North Queensland), state/county (e.g. Queensland, Yorkshire, California) or country (e.g. New Zealand, Bangladesh). Do not choose an amusement park or a specific activity (e.g. tour).On considering your destination, make sure you have the necessary data and information to complete your task.Please do not focus on international regions (e.g. Australasia, Europe or South America) as these relationships can be extremely tricky to evaluate and analyse (e.g. the Brexit [in England] has complicated Europe’s management and marketing for tourism).Criteria & Marking:UQ Students: Please access the profile fromLearn.UQormySI-netto access marking criteria held in this profile.AI StatementThis assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
