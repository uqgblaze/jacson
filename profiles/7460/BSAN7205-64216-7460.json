Student teams are commissioned by the Brisbane-based analytics firm Aginic to develop this solution for the Edenglassie Department of Education: students are asked to investigate the role of data in transforming the education field and, accordingly, develop a business case and an initial prototype for an analytics solution that could enable teachers and corporate staff to make data-driven decisions that improve students’ learning experience.</p>\n<p>This assessment is group-based. Students are supported by an online white board that enables asynchronous contributions from each team member.</p>\n<p>Students will be required to complete a self and peer evaluation as part of this assignment. A series of review questions will be available on BlackBoard and should be completed on submission of your teams manual. The evaluation process assists the teaching team to understand how each student contributed and the findings are confidential. The peer evaluation can affect each student's mark for this assignment. Further details will be provided in class and on Blackboard. This assessment builds student employability by providing an opportunity to access knowledge, think critically, problem solve and work in a team.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
