Cases will be identified in class and through Learn.UQ. This assessment has three aspects.First, the team should present and summarise the key challenges and issues identified as arising from the case.Second, the team should present a strategic direction forward for the organisation that makes recommendations regarding IT governance mechanisms and strategy choices to the executive audience indicated by the case. These recommendations are informed by the organisational context of the case as discussed in seminars.Third, after the 15 minute presentation, the team leads a question-and-answer discussion with other students (acting in the role of the Board) for up to 10 minutes.The last scheduled day of classwork is devoted to the Board Presentation.The first and second aspects (summary and strategic direction forward) should be presented in an approximately 15 minute presentation. The structured presentation requires the audience to act and participate as stakeholders of the organisation discussed in the case (that is, class members act as board members or stakeholders as described in the case scenario). All presentation materials are to be submitted by the end of the teaching day.AI StatementThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

            "task_description": "You are to write an Executive Briefing that assesses the impact and implications for the organisation of one of three innovative information technologies for an organisation of interest to the student. In some circumstances, alternative information technologies may be assessed with permission from the lecturer. The technology to be considered is one of blockchain, artificial intelligence, or business process automation. You are to prepare a short briefing paper appropriate for presentation to the organisation's Board of Directors that make recommendations appropriate to the scenario that make the organisation more 'future ready' than it currently is.The enterprise may be any existing real-world enterprise. In practice, this might be the student's current employer, or perhaps a targeted future employer.The Executive Briefing provides an introduction followed by a short background of the organisation. As a briefing, no Executive Summary is required. The briefing then describes the information technology for a non-IT literate audience. The report then analyses the prospective impact of the technology's adoption upon the relevant industry and its implications for industry participants (including the organisation). These implications are analysed to develop recommendations that improve the future-readiness of the organisation for adoption of the information technology within the industry. The briefing presents specific and focussed recommendations (between 4 and 6 recommendations) that are actionable by the Board.These recommendations are to include priority (top 3) changes to existing IT governance and management practices.The analysis should draw on analytical techniques discussed in seminars.Note that even if the organisation were not to adopt the information technology, its adoption by the wider industry would require the organisation to make changes that make the organisation more 'future ready'.The challenges, analysis, and recommendations are to be supported by current research.Key to success in this assessment is the description of the technological elements, analysis of the value proposition and impacts/risks (or potential impacts/risks) upon the entity, and the development of recommendations from the analysis. In your analysis, consider a specific example of how the information technology is or might be used (going into some detail into a specific example). You should aim to describe and analyse actual events that have either happened or are unfolding now through current real-world examples. Finally, it is important that the Executive Briefing be clear and concise. Key points may be bolded, and/or the briefing may be presented in dot point format (but it must be structured and coherent if this approach is adopted).AI StatementThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
