The journal is both a reflective document of your skills growth as well as a record of your ability to understand and apply key theories and analytical frameworks to organisational innovation problems. It will serve as an important guide to build your career in becoming an innovation leader.During the relevant weeks you will be asked to make a submission to the research journal with a reflection on or application of relevant theories and frameworks covered in those weeks. The total assessment is worth 60 marks, but it is broken up in three parts to offer you the opportunity to gain feedback on your learning and performance throughout the semester.Use of AIThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst you may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. To pass this assessment, you will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.You must clearly reference any use of AI in each instance including providing an appendix with used prompts. A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
