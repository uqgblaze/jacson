This means you will be assigned to an organisation/event (based on your lecture and tutorial) where you will <em>create the event concept - then implement the event - from start to finish.</em></p>\n<p>You will work in smaller teams to design each component of the event (eg, establishment of sub committees that may include sponsorship, marketing, operations, ticketing and registration (or customer service), or other committees relevant to your specific event). To help you plan for and deliver the event successfully, your team will create an Event Pitch. As part of this process, your team will be required to give a short Event Pitch for the purpose of gaining and using feedback to improve your Event Manual and live event. <strong>While this is a pitch, your group should submit a complete set of ALL materials for your planned activities.</strong></p>\n<p>THE EVENT PITCH</p>\n<p>Your team will present its Event Pitch based on a plan for one (1) of the following topics - based on the group to which you are assigned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Positioning</li>\n<li>Marketing</li>\n<li>Ticketing and registration/Customer service</li>\n<li>Sponsorship</li>\n<li>Venue/operations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Event Pitch will be a maximum of 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>NOTE: While all members of your team will contribute to the preparation of the pitch, given the strict 10 minute time limit, not all team members have to present. However, ALL members of the team must be present at the pitch and also be prepared to answer questions asked by the 'event manager' (your teacher).</p>\n<p>The pitch will be presented live in the tutorial, and you will need to respond to questions about the pitch live in the tutorial. Please Note:<strong> </strong>The pitch will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.</p>\n<p>The Event Pitch will be assessed on your team presentation, persuasiveness, suitability of the content of the pitch to the positioning of the event, and your team's ability to respond to questions and feedback. The completeness and quality of the materials for your functional area will also be assessed. Additionally, the Event Pitch will be assessed on the congruence and fit with the plans of other functional groups.</p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION - VERY IMPORTANT:</p>\n<p>In the workplace, you are required to turn up to work regularly. Because of the nature of this course (ie, preparation for a real event which requires a complete team effort), you are expected to attend classes/tutorials/consultations every week as this will be the meeting time for committees to liaise with one another and communicate with the other committees about weekly progress. It will also give you the opportunity to check progress and seek feedback from the Event Manager.</p>\n<p>Further details about the Event Pitch will be discussed in our Week 1 class.</p>\n<p>Finally, towards the end of the semester, as part of our course and event debriefing, you will be required to participate in a self- and peer-evaluation activity.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT). Students are advised that the use of AI or MT technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under theStudent Code of Conduct.</p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
