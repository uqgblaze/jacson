The Report should cover computation, theory discussion and hedging suggestions. The Report focuses on examining your critical analytical skills and ability to work with real-life case scenarios. You are expected to undertake a certain amount of research to complete this Report.You are also required to complete aReflective PieceandPeer Assessment Reviewindividually after your team has submitted the Report. The Peer Assessment Review will be used to compute your final grade on the Report (25%). Completing the Peer Assessment Review is mandatory. If you do not submit a Peer Assessment Review form, you will receive a score of zero on the Report. The Peer Assessment Review will be completed on Blackboard and is integrated into the Blackboard teams.Further details about the Team Project will be discussed during the semester.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
