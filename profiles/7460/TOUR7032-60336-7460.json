As an example, if your group chooses Coffs Harbour as the main case, then each one of you will independently compare one of the competitors to it.The focus on this assignment is the competitor destination (i.e. Port Stephens in relation to Coffs Harbour).You will have to:Identify the regional competitor for the destination and state why it is a competitor (200 to 300 words)Conduct an environmental analysis of your destination in comparison to the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the competing destination (approximately 300 words)Identify the competitive strengths of your destination (approximately 300 to 500 words)Compare those strengths with the identified strengths indicated in the assigned marketing plan (approximately 300 to 500 words)From here, identify how the destination should be positioned and branded in relation to its competitors (approximately 300 to 500 words)A few points to remember:To complete this assignment, you will have to read deeply the marketing plan and also conduct and extensive internet search of both the destination and its main case competitorMost SWOT analyses are done poorly. They are only valid if they are compared to something or some competitive destination. Saying that a destination hasxnumber of hotel rooms is a fact. It may be a strength if competitors have fewer rooms, or a weakness if they have more rooms.Opportunities and threats should represent macro environmental issues affecting the destination. Many destinations mistake strengths and weaknesses as opportunities and threats.You can use sentences and paragraphs, point form and tables if they are more appropriate to convey your message. Just remember to make sure the thought is complete if using point form.Most of these marketing plans have been developed by professionals in the industry or by experienced consultants. It is perfectly acceptable to agree with the positioning and branding strategies as long as you can justify this conclusion based on your own researchAI StatementThis assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
