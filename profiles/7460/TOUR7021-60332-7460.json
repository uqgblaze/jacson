This assignment requires you to reflect upon your own service experiences on a daily basis, from a customer perspective, and then critically analyse one of these experiences through the lens of a relevant service management principle. The service management principles that can be used will be discussed in class and include: Service Characteristics, Service Quality and Dual Value Creation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Students will share their individual service experience (from Assignment 1) through a 2000 word Report, including an Executive Summary, Service Experience Overview, Literature Review and Recommendations. This should provide sufficient description of a service experience that you have recently experienced. However, the main emphasis should be on the clear connection between ‘what happened’ and a relevant service principle. Using the principle, you should critically analyse the experience, and depending on the context, offer insights, draw a conclusion and/or offer recommendations. Develop this Report with industry (managers / leaders) being your target audience who should learn/benefit from your insights.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The main emphasis is on your ability to apply service management principles in a real life context.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
