This assessment task covers learning materials presented in lectures, tutorials and the relevant textbook chapters from week 1 to week 5 inclusive. You may need to perform information retrieval tasks using SQL queries.It is mandatory to attend your allocated tutorial time, and if you cannot attend, you must apply for a deferred quiz. Due to other classes scheduled after your tutorial, it is crucial to arrive and finish on time. If you plan to use your laptop, ensure it is compatible with the required software and has a stable internet connection. Further information about the exam will be presented during lectures.AI Statement:Note: This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Students will be required to demonstrate their knowledge and ability to use SQL. The fundamental knowledge and skills required for this assessment task are expected to be cultivated through lectures and tutorials. However, students will need to conduct additional research to further enhance the skills necessary to successfully complete this assessment.Team formation and teamwork:You will undertake this project as a part of a team of 3 to 5 members.Project team members must be allocated to the same tutorial. You will submit portions of the project at intervals, receive oral comments on your work during the informal presentations from your tutor, and revise earlier submissions.Feedback on draft submissions (iterations 1 and 2)Iteration 1during week 8 tutorials. The submission due date will be announced on BlackBoard.Iteration 2during week 11 tutorials. The submission due date will be announced on  BlackBoard.Peer Assessment:5% of the mark for this assessment will be determined by the members of your group, who will assess your contribution to the project against 4 criteria, for a mark out of 5. A link will be provided on Blackboard for this evaluation.If you mark other group members for any criteria at 3 or below, you must provide a comment to justify your low mark.If you mark low without a comment, the mark you have given will be changed, without consultation.If you do not fill out your peer assessment, you may be given a mark of zero for this part of the assessment or you may be allocated the mark based on the marks given by the rest of your team.Peer Assessment CriteriaProject Management - the extent to which someone participates in setting up processes, such as meeting times and work submission deadlines, which will lead to successful and timely completion of the project.Knowledge - the extent to which someone has contributed knowledge and skills to work completionCommunication - the extent to which someone communicates respectfully, positively, and effectively with others in the group, in order to create group cohesion and get the project done with a minimum of conflict.Responsibility - the extent to which someone meets their obligations, like turning up to all meetings, and fully participating and taking all aspects of the project seriously.Working effectively in a Team:A Practical Guide MOOC explores ways in which to learn how to build effective teams, be a great team player, and manage team conflict. You are encouraged to complete this practical guide if you haven't done a team project before. Refer toTeams101x MOOC.AI Statement:This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic, and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools. If AI has been used it must be acknowledged.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
