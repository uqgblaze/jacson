Students will be required to demonstrate their knowledge and ability to use SQL. The fundamental knowledge and skills required for this assessment task are expected to be cultivated through lectures and tutorials. However, students will need to conduct additional research to further enhance the skills necessary to successfully complete this assessment. </p>\n<p><strong>Team formation and teamwork: </strong>You will undertake this project as a part of a team of 3 to 5 members.<strong> </strong>Project team members must be allocated to the same tutorial. You will submit portions of the project at intervals, receive oral comments on your work during the informal presentations from your tutor, and revise earlier submissions. </p>\n<p><strong>Feedback on draft submissions (iterations 1 and 2)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Iteration 1</strong> during week 8 tutorials.

The submission due date will be announced on  BlackBoard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> Peer Assessment: </strong>5% of the mark for this assessment will be determined by the members of your group, who will assess your contribution to the project against 4 criteria, for a mark out of 5.

Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.
