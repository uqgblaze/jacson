Students will also need to think about things more from the issuers side. Students will need to read academic papers as well as regulatory information to answer short answer, essay style and numerical questions. It will involve the use of excel, and a bibliography will be required. </p>\n<p>This research based assignment will roughly take the following form. Students will need to:</p>\n<p>1. Identify how an issuer of certain financial instruments makes money. This will require research into the associated financial theory as well as contemporary market conditions. </p>\n<p>2. Given the knowledge of how issuers make money, students will then need to identify what risks the issuance of said instruments involves. Reference to current market conditions will be needed here. </p>\n<p>3. Students will then need to examine how an issuer's risk profile changes in certain scenarios. This will require the use of excel and a solid understanding of financial theory as well as the consequences of certain macoeconomic events.  </p>\n<p>4. Students are then required to research the position of the Australian regulator relative to said financial instrument and explain what restrictions this imposes on issuers.  </p>\n<p>Further details on the assignment will be provided on the Blackboard site. The assignment will have a maximum word count of 3,500 words.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
