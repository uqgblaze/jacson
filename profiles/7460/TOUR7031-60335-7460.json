You will need to visit the site but can also use virtual tours and other online resources to inform your critique.</li>\n<li>Using the guidelines from the Queensland Museum field trip, write a critique of the various visitor facilities and services offered at <strong>your </strong>chosen site.</li>\n<li>Please include photographs to illustrate your points, including a selfie of you at your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>PART 1: BACKGROUND (approx. 700 words)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe the site – what is it (museum, national park etc), where is it, how long has it been there etc.</li>\n<li>Provide a map or diagram of the site</li>\n<li>Identify <strong>ONE</strong> target market that you will be using as the basis of your report and briefly discuss their likely motives and interests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>PART 2: CRITIQUE (approx. 2,000 words)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drawing from relevant lecture content and using the checklist provided, note how well the site is likely to meet the needs and interests of the <strong>ONE target market</strong> you have identified. In particular, you should discuss:</li>\n<li>Entrance/welcoming area</li>\n<li>Visitor facilities</li>\n<li>Visitor comfort</li>\n<li>Orientation (both internal and external directional signs)</li>\n<li>Visitor engagement</li>\n<li>Interpretive signs</li>\n<li>Exhibit design issues</li>\n<li>Maintenance</li>\n<li>Highlight the areas and aspects that are done well and those that could be improved.
