When developing a business model one must take into account the current context and environment the business model will exist in. This assessment will require students to complete a detailed Business Model Environment Map (BMEM) including an analysis of:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Key Trends</li>\n<li>Industry Forces</li>\n<li>Market Forces; and</li>\n<li>Macroeconomic Forces</li>\n<li><strong>Students should highlight the most relevant insights gained through this analysis and how they are relevant to their project.</strong></li>\n<li>A detailed overview of the BMEM is available in class resources</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>External Discovery </strong>– New products, services and business models exist and are relevant at a specific point in time. When endeavouring to challenge the status quo one must consider the past, present and emerging context and environment. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> Students should assemble a cohesive analysis of the status quo context by:</p>\n<p>a.  Identifying the top 5 organisations and the 5 fastest growing start-ups/social enterprises solving the relevant problem or exploiting a relevant opportunity.</p>\n<p>b.  Analyse scholarly literature reviews to identify current and emerging challenges, trends and opportunities.</p>\n<p>c.  Create an ecosystem map, identifying all the key stakeholders and the relationships between them</p>\n<p><strong>Students should summarise the most relevant insights and how they relate to their project.</strong></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Humble Discovery</strong> - Thick Data is the best method for mapping unknown territory as it provides something External (Big) Data explicitly does not — inspiration. The act of collecting and analysing stories produces insights. Thick Data uses qualitative, ethnographic methods to uncover people’s emotions, stories, and models of their world. It’s the sticky stuff that’s difficult to quantify. It only requires a small sample size which can deliver an depth of meanings and stories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>a)  Conduct a minimum of 20 in person interviews (not surveys) across at least three types of stakeholders including customers, users, beneficiaries, economic buyers, decision-makers and saboteurs to identify unsatisfied social, emotional and functional jobs and unrealised opportunities.</p>\n<p>b)  Present <strong>2 customer empathy maps</strong>. One for the <strong>primary consumer, user, beneficiary</strong> and one for the f<strong>irst best customer, economic buyer</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Experiments </strong>- Demonstrate how you have used experiments to identify and engage relevant stakeholders to test assumptions and gain insights. Examples of no cost experiments are found in Module 4 and include:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>·      A very basic landing page</p>\n<p>·      A simple LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok or Reddit post</p>\n<p>·      Online or in-person seminars, webinars and focus groups</p>\n<p>·      An Immersion experience (see IDEO’s Field Guide to Human Centred Design)</p>\n<p>·      Stakeholders diary (see module 4)</p>\n<p>·      Any tool described in the Stanford Pretotype table (see module 4)</p>\n<p>·      Get potential users and customers to look at or try a low-fidelity MVP</p>\n<p>·      Use your imagination</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written (and or audio visual) submission independent of AI tools.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Students cannot have any audio visual (ie AI generated avatar) presenting any part of their assessment. </strong></p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
