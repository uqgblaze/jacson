From these briefs, the groups develop event tourism proposals directly in response to the client’s real world problems and objectives. The proposals will cover all topics in the course including scoping, site selection, site layout, staffing and volunteer requirements, staging and logistics, risk management, and financing and budgets.Students use the project management tools they have developed throughout the term including Gantt charts, run sheets, work break down structure, and site maps to support their proposal. The project will be conducted in partnership with EventsAir, the industry leading project management software program, to provide students with software training in developing their proposal. The presentation and report will be delivered directly to the client at the end of the term.Teams will be created by the students with assistance from the teaching staff in week 1. Students will work in these groups all semester.No hard copy reportis required but supplementary materials such as site plans, timelines etc. are allowed as handouts with a limit of 10 single sided pages maximum.Your mark will be based on your individual contribution to the assessment task. Thus, you will be required to complete a peer evaluation at mid-semester and the end of the semester. Individual grades will be calculated as the group score (self-rated score included) weighted by the peer evaluation score.The pitch will be presented to the client and teaching staff at the end of the semester and will be12 minutesin duration maximum.Complete details regarding the assessment task will be provided on Blackboard.The my.uq website for Study Skills->Group Workhttps://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/student-support/study-skills/group-workUQ’s edX course - Working in Teams: A Practical Guidehttps://www.edx.org/course/working-in-teams-a-practical-guideThis assessment task is to be completed in-person.
