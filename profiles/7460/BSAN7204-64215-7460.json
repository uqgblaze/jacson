Correctly answering each question is worth 0.5 marks towards your overall grade (for a maximum of 20 marks). You can attempt each question as many times as you like before the due date. (There is no penalty for incorrect answers.)You are encouraged to discuss how to answer the questions with your peers on Ed Discussion.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Your analysis should demonstrate the application the three core methods from Modules 3 and 4:Multiple linear regressionLogistic regression and multiple logistic regressionTime seriesYou will then present your insights from this analysis as a technical report to your supervisor and as a persuasive presentation to the stakeholders.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes.This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
