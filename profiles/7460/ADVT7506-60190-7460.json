In order to gain consumer insights, advertising managers frequently embark on a discovery process to understand the client’s brand, its competitors, and the target audience. In this assessment, you are required to undertake research, on a specific product/service (the client brief will be provided to you) and develop the key consumer insight/s and an advertising strategy statement. This is an individual assessment and as such, students should not work with/collaborate with other students in the cohort when working on this written report.The Consumer Insight Analysis report word count is 1500 words. A step-by-step project guide, including full details of the individual report, will be located in the assessment folder on the unit’s Blackboard site. Please refer to this guide for full details of this individual report. The insights gained from this assessment item will be used/built on, for inclusion in the final group Advertising Campaign project. All submissions must be written in English.This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

            "task_description": "The purpose of this assessment is to provide you with valuable experience in critically analysing advertising issues from both an academic and practitioner viewpoint and identify how they can be utilised by organisations in their communication strategies. This assessment is to be completed as a team project and offers you an exciting opportunity to develop a full advertising campaign. In response to the client brief, each team is required to formally prepare a presentation [the “Pitch”] for their advertising project findings. The insights gained from students' individual Consumer Insight Analysis assessments can be used/built on for inclusion in this group Advertising Campaign project.Teams will comprise 5 students and presentations will be delivered during tutorials of Week 12 and Week 13. Presentation scheduling will be managed by your tutor in a prior class. The Pitch presentation document will be due for submission on the DUE DATE (regardless of which week your group will present).The Pitch presentation will be restricted to 15 minutes per team and 5 minutes for Q&A. Presentations need to be of a professional standard as if you were presenting your solution to the Client. All members of the group must speak in the presentation, but not necessarily for the same amount of time.Detailed assessment guidelines and the marking criteria sheet for this group assessment will be posted on Blackboard and discussed in the online lectures and workshops. The Pitch presentation must be delivered/submitted in English.SELF AND PEER REVIEW PROCESSGroup members are expected to contribute equally, fulfilling the tasks agreed on early in the semester. If there are disagreements in relation to team members' contributions that cannot be resolved, students must bring the problem to the attention of the Lecturer/Course Coordinator/Teaching Facilitator as early as possible. Students will be required to complete a Self and Peer Review Evaluation, reflecting on their own and their member's contributions during the development of the group assessment items. The team project grade will be derived from the results of the Peer evaluations. Further details will be outlined in the assessment guidelines document on Blackboard. Team members that work in good faith will not experience grade adjustments, while individuals that perform below expectations or fail to pull their weight will experience a negative grade adjustment. The Course Coordinator reserves the right to adjust peer evaluations to ensure fairness. Students are advised to be proactive and make expectations of one another clear from the start. Poor communication is often the source of discrepancies. It is expected that any problems that arise will be brought to the Course Coordinator's attention well before the assessment submission deadlines. Students who enrol late or do not engage with their team early, may be required to complete the task as an individual, or in a smaller team that may be formed of remaining students.This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
