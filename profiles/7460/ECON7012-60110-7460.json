This, in part, will require interventions at times by managers and choices to be made in order to coordinate information and knowledge to avoid wasted opportunities. The course also highlights the importance of understanding the roles consumption, investment, and government actions, which play in making business decisions, coordinating activities, and assessing strategic directions.</p>\n<p>Economic theories and concepts used in this course have examined how and why businesses and markets work the way they do. With this knowledge, students have been given a tool to assist in making more informed, strategic, business decisions.</p>\n<p>Using the perspectives outlined above, <strong>write an essay reflecting on a variety of economic concepts that impact your chosen business </strong>(where you are currently working, have worked in the past, or perhaps a future business where you plan to work). The essay must address the following points.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An Executive Summary is to be provided (note: these words ARE to be included in the assignment total word count). Details of what is needed in an Executive Summary can be found under the \"Assessment\" tab on Blackboard.</li>\n<li>Background information on the student’s chosen business is to be briefly outlined. The integration of relevant economic terminology should be used to clearly set the scene for the following sections.</li>\n<li>Using economic theory (incorporating graphs and relevant calculations as applicable), critically analyse past performances of your chosen buisness in relation to the market it operated in. Similarly, critically analyse the current performance of your chosen buisness in relation to the current market environment it now operates in.</li>\n<li>Based on the critical analysis, a detailed reflection is provided on what was learnt, what was confirmed, and what remains puzzling about the chosen business and the market it operates in. Clear linkages should be evident from your analysis and reflection to reveal what you perceive as the <strong>one key strategic issue</strong> your chosen business faces either now or in the future. It is advisable to use relevant analytical tools such as SWOT, PESTEL, Porter’s Five Force analysis etc. to provide insights to the economic analysis of your chosen business’s past, present and future performances. This should be used to help you identify the key strategic issue your chosen business faces. Any analysis using SWOT etc. needs to be included in an Appendix and NOT in the body of the assignment. Clearly though, the findings from such an analysis should be included in the body of the assignment.</li>\n<li><strong>Note</strong>: the words in the Appendix are NOT to be included in assignment total word count.</li>\n<li>Based on the lesson(s) you learnt from your critical analysis, and combining this with your identified key strategic issue, you must <strong>list two clear options to address the one key strategic issue</strong>. Both options need to be able to be implemented. For each option, use microeconomic theory to fully evaluate how each option address the key strategic issue and highlight the benefits to the business of implementing each option. Be sure to discuss and assess the assumptions you will have made when evaluating each option, and look at the impacts on your chosen business for each option if your assumptions prove to be incorrect.</li>\n<li>Using economic terminology and incorporating graphs, briefly explain how Australian macroeconomic indicators and policies are relevant to your chosen business. Evaluate any impacts on your options in trying to address the key strategic issue.</li>\n<li>Draws a conclusion from the analysis. Provides clearly supported recommendation(s) for management to address the identified strategic issue, along with implementation guidelines.</li>\n<li>Self-assess your assignment using the Major Assignment Marking Criteria document that is available on Blackboard. Please ensure you honestly self-assess. This self-assessment will not influence the grade awarded for this piece of assessment. However, your self-assessment thoughts are intended to be incorporated into the marker’s feedback. <strong>Please ensure you complete the self-assessment, using the Major Assignment Marking Criteria document on Blackboard, and include it as the last page of your assignment.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Submit your assignment online via Blackboard/Turnitin by the due date. To do this, go to the “Assessment” tab on Blackboard and follow the instructions there.</p>\n<p>NOTE: The essay is not to exceed <strong>a total of 2,700 words maximum</strong>, which includes the Executive Summary. Please note that words exceeding the 2,700 total word limit will not be marked. Appropriate headings based on the Major Assignment Marking Criteria sheet must be used in the essay.</p>\n<p>When submitting your assignment, please ensure: the first page is a cover page (with your name and student number), followed by your written assignment, then your completed self-assessment using the Major Assignment Marking Criteria document which includes your own self-assessed marks.</p>\n<p>The <strong>marking criteria</strong> can be found under the Assessment tab on Blackboard for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The self-assessment document called <strong>Major Assignment Marking Criteria,</strong> and</li>\n<li>The detailed marking rubric called <strong>Major Assignment Marking Rubric.</strong></li>\n<li>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
