Once you have formed a team, you are expected to complete a team charter that provides a summary of a broad goal e.g. a problem domain your team plans to focus on, a work breakdown structure to help organise/coordinate efforts, and individual photos of each team member. A template will be provided in Blackboard.</p>\n<p>AI policy</p>\n<p>Students may use AI in completing this assessment task by comparing what is generally understood about the customer problem (obtained by AI and industry research) and how this knowledge is expected to be nuanced, challenged, or extended by the customer discovery process in Assessment 2.
