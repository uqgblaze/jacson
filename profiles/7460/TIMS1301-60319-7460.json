Teamwork is a mandatory learning outcome of the course so it is imperative you make a team and decide on a problem domain that is well-suited to your skills, manageable resources, and/or networks. Once you have formed a team, you are expected to complete a team charter that provides a summary of a broad goal e.g. a problem domain your team plans to focus on, a work breakdown structure to help organise/coordinate efforts, and individual photos of each team member. A template will be provided in Blackboard.AI policyStudents may use AI in completing this assessment task by comparing what is generally understood about the customer problem (obtained by AI and industry research) and how this knowledge is expected to be nuanced, challenged, or extended by the customer discovery process in Assessment 2. Students must clearly reference any use of AI in each instance. A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.More details about the assignment can be found on Blackboard.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
