            "task_description": "This is an individual assessment item (not a group assessment).You are required to write an essay of not more than 2000 words excluding the reference section, on the topic of improving the design of one specific international service operations process using the same organisation that your group chose for the oral presentation assessment. Note that in this Service Operations Management course we cover a wide range of concepts that students can use to map service operations and service processes. We have also cover concepts that can be applied to for instance identify and reduce waste, improve service quality, improve service process design etc and students should select the most relevant course concepts to assist them in writing persuasive arguments for making improvements to the deign of one service of your chosen company.You will write an essay that includes an introduction, body section (paragraphs) and conclusion (note that there are some resources we have provided below on this page on how to write and structure an essay). The body section of your essay will contain paragraphs. Each paragraph will make a persuasive argument that identify one key, important area for improvement supported by relevant course theory concepts (note that students need to conduct further reading beyond the textbook and beyond course readings of the relevant service operations management academic literature to make strong academic literature supported arguments for your suggested improvements) and also supported with secondary research evidence (eg from industry reports, industry journals, newspapers etc) and suggesting realistic solutions for these areas of improvement.There may be many aspects you could improve but you will need to prioritise! Be sure to clearly and persuasively argue in your essay using research evidence and theory to make a case for the most important opportunities for improvement in the design of one service process. You will need to provide secondary research evidence when arguing for making significant improvements (we recommend you only select two to three arguments/paragraphs for improving the design of the service and write concisely as the overall word count of this essay is only 2000 words). If it is a very large organisation/company that you have chosen, be sure to specify the specific service process you have chosen to focus on improving.Note that a key requirement of this assessment is that you need to cover a minimum of 3 course seminar topics in your essay (ie select highly relevant course concepts from 3 or more seminar weeks).You will be assessed on the depth and appropriateness of your international service operations academic literature as well as secondary research (evidence based market and academic literature research to base your analysis and recommendations on) and critical analysis as well as choice and depth of service process related discussion. As well as your ability to demonstrate understanding and apply relevant theory and use literature to support your arguments (concepts we have covered in this course - be sure to include a reference when stating/applying key concepts in your report).A minimum of 10 authoritative, relevant references must be included and to achieve a high level of achievement in this assessment you will need to exceed the minimum - please also refer to the assessment marking rubric.The appropriate service operations mapping, service charting, service process mapping and tools of analysis and Service Operations Management concepts should be applied. You are encouraged to include process maps, charts/graphs such as histograms or other visualisations in this essay to support your arguments.The purpose of the process of the company should be evident – what does service success look like through the eyes of the customer of your selected company? Reminder that you should also make clear what theoretical underpinning supports your discussion.Important Note: All assessment tasks in this course prohibit the use of AI.

You will then present a critical analysis of the company's service operations as it relates to your specific company service that you have chosen to focus on (be sure to include at least one other company competitor and one other industry to compare/contrast). You will need to critically evaluate 2 to 3 alternative options for potential solutions and assess these using criteria your team has developed before deciding on your final recommended solution. You will then present your recommendations for improvements to the company's service operations and state your conclusions. Please refer to the marking rubric for full requirements. Your presentation need to be supported with at least 10 credible industry references as well as an additional 5 academic literature references to support and justify your critical analysis.Presentation timing - refer to the course Blackboard site Assessment section.
