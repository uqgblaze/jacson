The purpose of the Formative Quiz is to introduce students to the Inspera exam platform, and provide students with a self-test function to review their understanding of core concept covered in Module 1.Online Quizzes will be completed in Weeks 6 and 13. The Quiz will include 30 multiple choice questions covering LearnX content, required readings and in-class activities content. Each quiz question is worth ½ a mark each. Once started you will have a maximum of 60 minutes to complete all questions.This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The exam is theory based, requiring application of knowledge to real world consumer examples and/or problems.This exam will be invigilated and use the Inspera Assessment Platform. You will need access to a webcam and audio since this will be a camera-invigilated examination. Inspera Assessment provides additional functionality to complement the existing suite of digital learning tools at UQ with a greater range of question types, accessibility provisions, and non-English languages.Preparation for the online exam will be discussed in lectures and during applied activities in workshop.This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The written case study will include primary research evidence such as quotes from interviewed consumers, as well as secondary evidence from marketing and consumer journals, and industry reports to support analysis of the problem.The case study assessment has TWO components:Case study topic and research plan (10%) Due Week 7: Friday 6 September @ 10amThe purpose of the planning document is to demonstrate how information and data will be gathered to inform the written consumer behaviour case study. The planning document will include: details of the secondary data search strategy and preliminary summary of important academic and industry/news references, a research mind map, primary research data collection details including sampling information and a draft interview guide. Students will be expected to complete 3 consumer interviews to inform their case study analysis.Consumer behaviour case study (30%) Due Monday 28 October @ 12pmThe problem-based case study will follow an essay format including key content headings: problem background and statement, presentation of research (primary consumer research and secondary background research), analysis of the problem applying appropriate consumer behaviour theory and concepts, and consumer marketing recommendations providing a solution to the problem.Word limit: 3000 wordsResearch:Students are expected to use academic and industry/news references. At a minimum, students need to include key theory and models discussed in workshops and learning resources and synthesise academic and industry secondary research to obtain a passing grade.Teamwork:Teams will be formed during Week 2 tutorials and must be finalised in Week 3. Students can only form teams with members of their own tutorial group. Students who enrol late or do not engage with their team early in the course may be required to complete the task as an individual, or in a smaller team that may formed of remaining students.Teamwork is a valuable and important component of this university program. Students should be aware that in normal circumstances, all members of the team will receive the same mark for the case study, unless individual group issues are proactively identified prior to deadlines to enable resolutions.A team contract will be submitted during Week 5. Further, peer evaluation will be undertaken by all teams and will be considered in conjunction with the team contract and group records. Group contributions should be monitored weekly and proactive issues management should be implemented. Often issues are managed through clear communications and can be resolved for positive team outcomes and as such, all group issues should be flagged immediately with your tutor. It is essential that teams attempt to resolve issues during the case study project. However, individuals who are shown to not perform to the group standard, will be penalized, having marks deducted to a standard which reflects the evidence, which may include receiving zero marks where warranted. In such situations, all individuals are responsible for keeping evidence of their contributions to the group.Ensuring academic integrity:This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will proviRead full task descriptionHide full task description",
