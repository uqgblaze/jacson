All learning team members must contribute toward the group presentation.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes. If a student is absent from the scheduled presentation without a valid excuse, they will receive no marks for the assignment.Students will be required to complete a Peer Review Evaluation, reflecting on their own and their member's contributions during the development of the group assessment items. A student's final grade for this assessment item could be altered based on feedback from the Peer evaluations.All students in the group will receive the same mark. Therefore, group members are expected to contribute equally, fulfilling the tasks agreed on early in the semester. If there are disagreements in relation to team members' contributions that cannot be resolved, students must bring the problem to the attention of the Course Coordinator/Tutor/Facilitator as early as possible. It is expected that any problems that arise will be brought to the Course Coordinator's attention well before the assessment submission deadlines.Group members that work in good faith will not experience grade adjustments, while individuals that perform below expectations or fail to pull their weight will experience a negative grade adjustment. The Course Coordinator reserves the right to adjust peer evaluations to ensure fairness.Students are advised to be proactive and make expectations of one another clear from the start. Poor communication is often the source of discrepancies.Each group will be required to submit details of the contributions of each member. Contributions will be used to adjust students' individual group assignment results.Criteria & MarkingDetails about this assessment item and the Marking Criteria rubric are available on the course Blackboard site.AI Statement:Academic integrity policy is in effect in this course.
