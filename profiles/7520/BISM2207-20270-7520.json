Students will be required to demonstrate their knowledge and ability to use SQL. The fundamental knowledge and skills required for this assessment task are expected to be cultivated through lectures and tutorials. However, students will need to conduct additional research to further enhance the skills necessary to successfully complete this assessment.Team formation and teamwork:You will undertake this project as a part of a team of 3 to 5 members.Project team members must be allocated to the same tutorial. You will submit portions of the project at intervals, receive oral comments on your work during the informal presentations from your tutor, and revise earlier submissions.Feedback on draft submissions (iterations 1 and 2):You will submit portions of the project at intervals (two draft points/iterations), receive oral comments on your work, and revise earlier submissions accordingly. These submissions are for feedback only and are not graded.Iteration 1during week 8 tutorials. The submission due date will be announced on Blackboard.Iteration 2during week 11 tutorials. The submission due date will be announced on Blackboard.Peer Assessment:students will be required to complete a self and peer evaluation as part of this assignment. The evaluation process assists the teaching team to understand how each student contributed and the findings are confidential. The peer evaluation can affect each student's mark for this assignment. A link will be provided on Blackboard for this evaluation.Working effectively in a Team:A Practical Guide MOOC explores ways in which to learn how to build effective teams, be a great team player, and manage team conflict. You are encouraged to complete this practical guide if you haven't done a team project before. Refer toTeams101x MOOC.AI Statement:This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic, and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submissions independent of AI tools. If AI has been used it must be acknowledged.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
