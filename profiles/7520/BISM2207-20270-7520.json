Students will be required to demonstrate their knowledge and ability to use SQL. The fundamental knowledge and skills required for this assessment task are expected to be cultivated through lectures and tutorials. However, students will need to conduct additional research to further enhance the skills necessary to successfully complete this assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Team formation and teamwork: </strong>You will undertake this project as a part of a team of 3 to 5 members.<strong> </strong>Project team members must be allocated to the same tutorial. You will submit portions of the project at intervals, receive oral comments on your work during the informal presentations from your tutor, and revise earlier submissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback on draft submissions (iterations 1 and 2): </strong>You will submit portions of the project at intervals (two draft points/iterations), receive oral comments on your work, and revise earlier submissions accordingly. These submissions are for feedback only and are not graded.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Iteration 1</strong> during week 8 tutorials. The submission due date will be announced on Blackboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Iteration 2</strong> during week 11 tutorials. The submission due date will be announced on Blackboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Peer Assessment: </strong>students will be required to complete a self and peer evaluation as part of this assignment. The evaluation process assists the teaching team to understand how each student contributed and the findings are confidential. The peer evaluation can affect each student's mark for this assignment. A link will be provided on Blackboard for this evaluation. </p>\n<p><strong>Working effectively in a Team: </strong>A Practical Guide MOOC explores ways in which to learn how to build effective teams, be a great team player, and manage team conflict.
