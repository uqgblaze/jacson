            "task_description": "Students will primarily be working in groups on a project for all 3 assessment items, although students will be evaluated individually to assess their contribution to the group assignments.There are two components to Assignment 1Component 1- The Student group will prepare a pre-recorded PowerPoint presentation and submit it along with a PDF of their slides to Black Board.The Presentation must cover the following components:Big Data –Situational analysis of context, trends, innovations and challengesHumble Discovery –Qualitative interviews and observations of stakeholdersExperiments– In person and online experiments to identify and engage stakeholders to gain and test assumptions and insights.Component 2 - Each student will present in class a brief summary of the key Humble Discovery Insights they contributed to Assignment 11. Big Data– New products, services and business models exist and are relevant at a specific point in time. One must consider the past, present and emerging context and environment when endeavouring to challenge the status quo.Students should assemble a cohesive analysis of the status quo context by:Highlighting the most relevant insights gained through analysis of their Business Model Environment Map (BMEM) questionnaire to identify current and emerging challenges, trends and opportunities, and how they are relevant to their project. (BMEM details supplied in class)Identifying the top 3 organisations and the 3 fastest growing start-ups/social enterprises solving the relevant problem or exploiting a relevant opportunity.Create an ecosystem map, identifying all the key stakeholders and the relationships between them.Students should summarise the most relevant insights and how they relate to their project.2. Humble Discovery- Humble discovery is a method that relies on building empathy to understand specific people groups for the purpose of improving their lives with new solutions for unresolved problems and unrealised or latent opportunities. It requires exploring and reflecting on one's own skills and passions and asking a series of questions including: Who are we here for? What do they need that they cannot get now? How can we help them do better? These questions are at the heart of innovation and require us to think deeply about the human experience. The act of collecting and analysing stories from conversations with people produces insights. We call this \"Thick Data\" and it includes using qualitative and ethnographic methods to uncover people’s functional, social and emotional jobs to be done, their goals and associated driving and restraining forces that keep the status quo in stasis. The innovator collects and makes sense of the insights that emerge from collecting these stories. The innovator then uses cognitive inference, that is, connecting unrelated data to create a picture of what someone wants or needs but cannot get. It only requires a small sample size which can deliver a depth of meanings and stories.Tasks for this assessment item include:a)  Conduct a minimum of 20 in person conversations (not surveys) across at least three types of stakeholders including users, beneficiaries, economic buyers and decision-makers. Record the key insights from these conversations and synthesise all the data to identify unsatisfied social, emotional and functional jobs, and goals and the associated driving and restraining forces that are preventing stakeholders from achieving unrealised opportunities.b)  Present2 Stakeholder Insight Profile's.One for theprimary user and/or beneficiaryand one for thedecision makerand oreconomic buyer.3. Experiments- Demonstrate how you have used experiments to identify and engage relevant stakeholders for further interview and conversation and also to test accuracy and the scale of the assumptions and insights that emanate from you big data and humble discovery insights.Examples of no-cost experiments are found in Module 4 and include:·A very basic landing page·A simple LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok or Reddit post·Online or in person seminars, webinars and focus groups·An Immersion experience (see IDEO’s Field guide to Human Centred Design)·Stakeholders diary (see module 4)·Any tool described in the Stanford Pretotype table (see module 4)·Get potential users and customers to look at or try a low fidelity MVP·Use your imaginationAI StatementThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written (and or audio visual) submission independent of AI tools.Students cannot have any audio visual (ie AI generated avatar) presenting any part of their assessment.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
