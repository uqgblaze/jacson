The project must begin by introducing the dataset by using descriptive analytics of the full dataset (i.e., describing all rows and columns of the dataset). Students must then select and provide a rationale for a specific subset of observations (rows) and variables (columns) of the MSD to be used for further analysis. Students must then provide descriptive statistics for all the variables in their chosen subset, a curated selection of data visualisations (univariate and bivariate displays) and one linear regression model. Throughout the project report, students must provide brief descriptions of the R functions used to generate their outputs.It is expected that Project 1 will be written using standard word processing software (e.g., Microsoft Word).AI StatementThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

Project 2 must include a re-writing of the initial analysis (corrected where necessary based on feedback), followed by applications of one or more techniques of model validation and dealing with missing data in their chosen subset of the MSD (the \"Million Song Dataset\"). Throughout Project 2, students must provide brief descriptions as plain text of the R functions used to generate their outputs, as well including the R syntax as R Markdown code chunks which generates the outputs included in the rendered report (.pdf).For Project 2, students must separately submit both the R Markdown file (.Rmd) and the report file (.pdf) it generates.AI StatementThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex.
