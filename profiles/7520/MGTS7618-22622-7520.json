Informal, emergent leaders and wise influencers are increasingly valued and invited to speak at conferences, professional associations, businesses, and youth groups interested in improving society. As such, this is an opportunity to practice designing your path to becoming a wise influencer for your community and society.As a group, you will work together **every week in tutorials** to examine challenges or problems in your community (the university; your home community; Brisbane area). You will decide on a specific challenge and design an initiative to address or solve the problem. Your tutors will work with you as mentors.In Week 9 you will do a practice presentation to another group in your tutorial and they will do a practice with you. You will give each other feedback on how to improve the project / presentation (5% of final grade)You will present your final proposal to class (30% of final grade). Presentation dates will be randomised for Week 11 or Week 12.Note that your individual grades for this assignment will be calculated partly from your group members' peer review scores on the quality of your contribution to the teamwork (e.g., ideas, organisation, emergent leadership).We work together on your group assignments in tutorials, therefore attendance in class is necessary.Detailed instructions will be provided on Blackboard and in class; and the process will be explained and workshopped in class.The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.AI Statement:Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
