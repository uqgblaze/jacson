Your team’s proposal must include the following details:1. Describing the research problem, and proposing the overall research aim and several objectives-Provide an overview of the research problem discussed by the clients.-Propose an overall research aim and several relevant research objectives for your project.2. A brief literature review on key concepts related to the topic.3. A clear research design that could address your research objectives, including a plan for data collection, sampling strategies that are used for data collection, and brief timeline.4. Reference listNote: There is no minimum reference number requirement, but you should have enough references to demonstrate your knowledge of the topic and justify your research design of the report.Week 12: Report (35%. moderated by individual performance)All teams submit a 4000-word written report,which includes all the details of the project, including project aim and objectives, literature review, methods (data collection and data analysis), results, discussion with the recommendation for clients, limitation, and conclusion.It is critical that a concerted effort is made to demonstrate a clear link between the research design, implementation, and data analysis. When preparing your report, ensure it follows a structured format and adheres to the provided sub-headings.Week 13: Poster presentation (10%)Each team is required to present a poster related to their project during the seminar in Week 13.Note: all team members need to be in attendance and participate in this seminar.Peer Assessment:Peer assessment will be conducted twice throughout the project.Referencesshould be inAPA style(click the hyperlink)Be very careful to avoid plagiarism. Information onAcademic integrity and student conductis available on the Library web site(click the hyperlink)Criteria & MarkingA Marking Guide with criteria and weighting is provided on Blackboard under the Assessment tab.SubmissionYou will be submitting your proposal and report throughTurnitin. Further details of the Task, and material to support your work, will be available on our course Blackboard site.Teamwork evaluation and reflectionwill be assessed at two stages (mid-term review, and final review). Collaborative skills are a basic graduate attribute that all students should enter the workplace with.The assessment criteria for collaborative skills are:1.Contribution– team member contributed to the process required to complete the assignment.2.Knowledge– team member contributed knowledge, opinions, and skills to team discussions and work completion.3.Collaboration & Communication– team member collaborated and communicated with others in the team and fulfilled their individual roles within the team.4.Responsibility– team member accepted responsibility for the team’s assignment outcome.More details will be provided in the blackboard.AI statement:This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Translation (MT) technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
