The three behaviours shall cover diverse industries rather than a single industry. A good starting point is to look at trends (or changes) in consumer decision-making process, consumption process, and post-consumption experiences during the past 10 to 20 years. Examples of potential consumer behaviour topics or areas will be provided and discussed during class.</li>\n<li>Provide background information (e.g., an overview of the phenomenon)</li>\n<li>Explain or justify consumer behaviour/effect/phenomenon (problem formulation/identification). Detailed guidelines will be provided in class.</li>\n<li>For each consumer behaviour, clearly state the research aim.</li>\n<li>For each consumer behaviour, formulate and spell out two research questions (i.e., a total of 6 research questions for the three consumer behaviours in Assessment 1).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The main purpose of this research proposal (Assessment 1) is to guide you in identifying a consumer behaviour topic, determining the research aim, and formulating and justifying relevant research questions. The teaching team will provide comprehensive feedback and suggestions on your submitted research proposal, which you are expected to incorporate into the independent research report (Assessment 2).</p>\n<p><strong>Peer Review: </strong>Group members are expected to contribute equally, fulfilling the tasks agreed on. If there are disagreements with team members' contributions that cannot be resolved, students must bring the problem to the attention of their Course Coordinator as early as possible. All students will be required to undertake a Peer Review process, which can influence the marks of those who do not contribute to group work.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
