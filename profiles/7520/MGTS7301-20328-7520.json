Students must then submit an 8-minute individual presentation (recorded in Teams or Zoom) that provides senior management with their strategic insights for the company in question, using the relevant strategy tools and techniques. The presentation should include a PowerPoint presentation with the camera on, and integrate digital copies of workshop deliberations e.g. pictures of worksheets in their presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge to synthesize insights from lecture concepts and workshop activities. Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop insights about the relevance of strategy tools and techniques to the particular case may be a helpful starting point. However the assessment evaluates student's abilities to present their insights in a compelling manner, drawing upon and integrating workshop insights in a unique and reflective manner.
