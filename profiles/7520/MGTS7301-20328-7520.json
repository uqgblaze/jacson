Students are highly encouraged to read the cases, actively participate in discussions, and deliberate how these tools and techniques can be practically applied. Students must then submit an 8-minute individual presentation (recorded in Teams or Zoom) that provides senior management with their strategic insights for the company in question, using the relevant strategy tools and techniques. The presentation should include a PowerPoint presentation with the camera on, and integrate digital copies of workshop deliberations e.g. pictures of worksheets in their presentation.AI StatementThis assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge to synthesize insights from lecture concepts and workshop activities. Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop insights about the relevance of strategy tools and techniques to the particular case may be a helpful starting point. However the assessment evaluates student's abilities to present their insights in a compelling manner, drawing upon and integrating workshop insights in a unique and reflective manner. The wholesale use of AI in this presentation may therefore constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

In the business design studio, the group is expected to draw upon three (3) tools and techniques from the available five (5) tools- GE Matrix, VRIN, BCG, Balanced Scorecard, and Strategy Diamond and justify, using a 'strategy as narrative' perspective, why these tools have been chosen as the most relevant tools and techniques for the case study company in question.At the end of the assessment task, all team members will be required to complete a peer assessment of each other's performance and contribution to the assessment. Instructions for how to do this will be provided in class.AI StatementStudents are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is a good starting point to help generate insights about the use of tools and techniques to their particular case.
