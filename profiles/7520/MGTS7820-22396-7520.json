Solving a jigsaw-like puzzle problem requires reducing ambiguity by collecting pieces of information or data and assembling them into a picture.

In contrast, disruptive and transformational products and services are often a surprise to incumbents because the insights are unexpected and unknowable in advance. These solutions are often created through cognitive inference, where a person links non-obvious ideas to create an unexpected product or service that embodies a new meaning that consumers, users and stakeholders love.",

This has led to not only growing investment into startup activity but also an increasingly institutionalized myth that entrepreneurial disruption is inseparable from both positive and negative intended and unintended social and environmental consequences.

This has led to not only growing investment into startup activity but also an increasingly institutionalized myth that entrepreneurial disruption is inseparable from both positive and negative intended and unintended social and environmental consequences. By focusing on the possibility of ventures engaging in more responsible innovation, we aim to facilitate larger-scale societal transition toward a new ideology. We refer to this outcome as a responsible entrepreneurship ideology (REI), which facilitates innovations that do not harm and, ideally, benefit society.\n\n\n\n\n      th, td {\n         position: relative;\n      }\n      th {\n         background: #f0f0f0;\n         border: 1px solid #dad7d7;\n         background-clip: padding-box;\n      }\n      td {\n         border: 1px solid lightgray;\n         padding: 4px;\n      }\n      .table-blot-wrapper {\n         position: relative;\n       }\n      .active-cell {\n        outline: 1px solid #066fa9;\n        background: rgba(193, 214, 253, 0.3);\n      }\n      .menu-placeholder {\n         position: absolute;\n         background: #dad7d7;\n         top: 50%;\n         transform: translateY(-50%);\n         right: 2px;\n         visibility: hidden;\n         z-index:1;\n         border-radius: 3px;\n         cursor: pointer;\n      }\n      .active-cell .menu-placeholder {\n       visibility:visible;\n      }\n      .cell-content {\n        line-height: 22px;\n        outline: none;\n        min-width: 120px;\n        min-height: 40px;\n        padding: 10px 0 10px 5px;\n      }\n      .table-operations-menu {\n        position: absolute;\n        width: 225px;\n        min-height: 100px;\n        top: 25px;\n        border-radius: 5px;\n        visibility: hidden;\n        padding: 10px 5px 10px 10px;\n        background: #fff;\n        box-shadow: -2px 2px 7px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n      }\n      .table-operations-menu-item {\n        padding: 4px 0;\n        cursor:pointer;\n        font-weight: normal;\n      }\n      .table-operations-menu-item img {\n        margin-right: 4px;\n        vertical-align: -4px;\n      }\n      .table-operations-menu-item.no-image {\n        padding-left: 24px;\n      }\n      .border-bottom {\n        border-bottom: 1px solid #dad7d7;\n        padding-bottom: 10px !important;\n        margin-bottom: 10px;\n      }\n      .set-background input {\n        width:14px;\n        height: 14px;\n        margin-right: 10px;\n        vertical-align: -2px;\n        cursor: pointer;\n      }\n      .color-box {\n        display: inline-block;\n        width: 20px;\n        height: 20px;\n        background: #f0f0f0;\n        border: solid 1px #dad7d7;\n        margin-left: 10px;\n        border-radius: 2px;\n        vertical-align: -4px;\n      }\n      .background-active {\n        background: #f0f0f0 !important;\n        outline: 1px solid #d7d7d7;\n      }\n      .text-format-item {\n        width: 20px !important;\n        display: inline-block;\n        margin-right: 5px;\n      }\n      .bold {\n        font-weight: bold !important;\n      }\n      .italic {\n        font-style: italic !important;\n      }\n      .underline {\n        text-decoration: underline !important;\n      }\n      .align-left {\n        text-align: left !important;\n      }\n      .align-right {\n        text-align: right !important;\n      }\n      .center {\n        text-align: center !important;\n      }",
