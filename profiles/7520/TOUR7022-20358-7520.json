Each key point must be ‘new’ to the discussions in the course.Secondly,generate a reasoned argument for why each of these key points are connected to the discussion of the issue and the discipline. These ‘connecting arguments’ must extend beyond the key point and be original, your own reasoning, and written in your own words.A one-page template will be provided on Blackboard to assist you in completing this assessment. The three Key Points and the Connecting Arguments MUST fit on the one page (using the formatting of the template).The requirements for this task will also be modelled during the initial tutorials so you understand how to complete the task.You have choice about which disciplines (and therefore which weeks) you wish to select for your submissions. The due date for the first possible submission is in Week Five and the latest possible submission date for your second paper is in Week Eleven.Submissions will be progressive and used to facilitate the tutorial discussions. Therefore, you will need to submit your discussion papers prior to the relevant tutorial.Each discipline has its own discussion paper due date, and these dates will be provided on the course Blackboard site.The marking criteria will be provided on the course Blackboard site.AI STATEMENTNote: The assessment tasks in this course have been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will requires students to critically engage in research and specific tasks for which AI will provide only limited assistance.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
