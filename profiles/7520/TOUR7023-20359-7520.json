An infographic is a visual representation of an idea or data, and yours should be succinct, entertaining, and eye-catching. It should cite the relevant literature and incorporate informative text and engaging images or graphics to appeal and explain your findings to your audiences. (https://www.canva.com/) (https://create.piktochart.com/infographic). Your infographic should address the following aspects:</p>\n<p>•         <strong>An overview of the destination</strong> (geographical location, types of attractions, visitor segment and statistics etc);</p>\n<p>•         A summary of the most relevant two (2) examples of natural, cultural and support resources available at this destination. This will require you to <strong>inform on the resource i) quality, ii) uniqueness and iii) appeal for 2 natural resources, 2 cultural resources and 2 social resources;</strong></p>\n<p>•         Explain <strong>the most important two (2) resource management challenges </strong>for your destination. Evidence-based justification of the identified challenges is necessary.</p>\n<p>•         <strong>Address each challenge strategically with one (1) possible management strategy</strong> that will overcome the challenge. The infographic includes, thus, two (2) strategies, one for each of the most important challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>Your research should be based on recent academic sources</strong> (published within the past 10 years). Attach your <strong>reference list following the APA reference guide on the audit and the infographic.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Complex/authentic assessment using AI to support learning: </strong>Students using AI must <strong>disclose one AI Statement</strong> and <strong>attach an Appendix</strong> with the prompts given to AI and the results provided by AI. A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. </p>\n<button class=\"collapsible__toggle\">\n<span class=\"collapsible__open link--icon icon--standard--arrow-down-1\">Read full task description</span>\n<span class=\"collapsible__close link--icon icon--standard--arrow-up-1\">Hide full task description</span>\n</button>\n</div>",
