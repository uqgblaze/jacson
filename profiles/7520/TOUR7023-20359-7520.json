An infographic is a visual representation of an idea or data, and yours should be succinct, entertaining, and eye-catching. It should cite the relevant literature and incorporate informative text and engaging images or graphics to appeal and explain your findings to your audiences. (https://www.canva.com/) (https://create.piktochart.com/infographic). Your infographic should address the following aspects:•An overview of the destination(geographical location, types of attractions, visitor segment and statistics etc);•         A summary of the most relevant two (2) examples of natural, cultural and support resources available at this destination. This will require you toinform on the resource i) quality, ii) uniqueness and iii) appeal for 2 natural resources, 2 cultural resources and 2 social resources;•         Explainthe most important two (2) resource management challengesfor your destination. Evidence-based justification of the identified challenges is necessary.•Address each challenge strategically with one (1) possible management strategythat will overcome the challenge. The infographic includes, thus, two (2) strategies, one for each of the most important challenges.Your research should be based on recent academic sources(published within the past 10 years).
