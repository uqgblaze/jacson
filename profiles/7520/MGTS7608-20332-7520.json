The case studies can be found in the Learning Module in the Learning Resources section on Blackboard.In this course, you will be placed into a tutorial for the semester. Within your tutorial, you will be placed into a group for the semester. As a formative learning exercise in weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, your group can choose to prepare a brief executive summary (500-750 words) relating to the case study. This assessment requires you to only submit four (4) executive summaries for marking over the semester. Whether you choose to prepare an executive summary each week is up to your group to decide. Completing more summaries will be helpful for you in making sure the 4 executive summaries you choose to submit are of a high standard. The questions you need to respond to in your executive summaries relating to the case studies for each week are available in the Learning Module. You will discuss the case study in class with your group and prepare the Executive Summary in class and the group will submit it during the tutorial via Blackboard.At the end of each Executive Summary, you will be required to submit details of the contributions of each member of the group. Contributions will be used to adjust students' individual group assignment results.Your tutor will provide you with feedback on your submission each week so that you can make improvements where needed in your subsequent submissions. The best 4 marks will contribute towards the final grade for each group.In completing this assignment students will have demonstrated their ability to work collaboratively in a group, identify issues in the business and society context, make a professionally written submission, apply multi-disciplinary knowledge, and produce a well-reasoned and evidence-based argument.AI Statement:This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
