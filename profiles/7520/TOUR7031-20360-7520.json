You will need to visit the site to complete the analysis.Using the guidelines from our field trip to the Queensland Museum, write a critique of the interpretation and visitor facilities atyourchosen site.Please include photographs to illustrate your points, including a selfie of you at your site.PART 1: BACKGROUND (approx. 700 words)Describe the site – what is it (museum, national park etc), where is it, how long has it been there etc.Provide a map or diagram of the siteChooseONEtarget market that you will be using as the basis of your report and briefly discuss their likely motives and interests.PART 2: CRITIQUE (approx. 1,500 words)Drawing from relevant lecture content and readings, note how well the site is likely to meet the needs and interests of theONE target marketyou have identified. Elements you could discuss:Entrance/sense of welcomeVisitor facilitiesVisitor comfortOrientation (internal and external directional signs)Visitor activitiesInterpretationMaintenanceHighlight the areas and aspects that are done well and those that could be improved. Justify this with your on-site observations and photographs.PART 3: RECOMMENDATIONS (approx. 800 words)Provide suggestions/recommendations for improvements to the identified weaknesses. You can also provide suggestions for how the site can further improve their strengths.Recommendations should clearly link to the needs and preferences of the ONE target market you have selected.  Clearly state what is recommended and how to achieve this. For example, it is insufficient to say there are no multi-lingual signs so the recommendation is to install multi-lingual signs. Rather, you should be stating WHY multilingual would be beneficial, WHERE they should be placed and WHAT specific languages should be considered.AI STATEMENTThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI and/or MT technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
