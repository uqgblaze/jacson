You will need to visit the site to complete the analysis.</li>\n<li>Using the guidelines from our field trip to the Queensland Museum, write a critique of the interpretation and visitor facilities at <strong>your </strong>chosen site.</li>\n<li>Please include photographs to illustrate your points, including a selfie of you at your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>PART 1: BACKGROUND (approx. 700 words)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe the site – what is it (museum, national park etc), where is it, how long has it been there etc.</li>\n<li>Provide a map or diagram of the site</li>\n<li>Choose <strong>ONE</strong> target market that you will be using as the basis of your report and briefly discuss their likely motives and interests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>PART 2: CRITIQUE (approx. 1,500 words)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drawing from relevant lecture content and readings, note how well the site is likely to meet the needs and interests of the <strong>ONE target market</strong> you have identified. Elements you could discuss:</li>\n<li>Entrance/sense of welcome</li>\n<li>Visitor facilities</li>\n<li>Visitor comfort</li>\n<li>Orientation (internal and external directional signs)</li>\n<li>Visitor activities</li>\n<li>Interpretation</li>\n<li>Maintenance</li>\n<li>Highlight the areas and aspects that are done well and those that could be improved.

You can also provide suggestions for how the site can further improve their strengths. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recommendations should clearly link to the needs and preferences of the ONE target market you have selected.  Clearly state what is recommended and how to achieve this.
