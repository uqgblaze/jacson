The assessment will take the form of a report to be submitted to clients.This is a GROUP assignment.Please note the following:(1) Each group will comprise of five (5) members. Group sign-on will be done through Blackboard AFTER the census date to minimise potential disruptions to groups.Initially, students will be given the opportunity to form their own group, so coordinate the sign-on with potential team members. If you are forming a team, it isimportant that all intended team members sign-up at the same time as open team slots could be filled by others. We will not remove individuals once they have signed up to a team.(2) Group sign-on will commence on Monday Week 8 (14th April, 9 am) and the link will be available until Thursday Week 8 (17th April, 3 pm). Students that have not signed up to a team by 3 pm 17th April will be randomly allocated to groups with fewer than five members.To ensure that all members of group contribute equally to the project, we will use peer evaluation. More information on peer evaluation will be posted closer to the date. Results of peer evaluation could be used to adjust students score in extreme circumstances. One such example of an \"extreme circumstance\" is where a student has ignored all communication and has contributed nothing to the submitted assignment. In this case, the student will be awarded a score of zero.AI Statement:This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
