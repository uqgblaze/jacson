A detailed description of the rationale, purpose and tasks of assessment 1 is provided below.SHRM Frameworks - A critique of practical applicationRationaleWhen HR professionals face an issue that requires an intervention they often turn to good practice examples and use of models or frameworks developed in research. This first assessment places you in that situation where you are exploring models or frameworks that have emerged from practice and have been discussed in the research. You are also required to consider any ethical implications of the SHRM models or frameworks.Assessment 1 is designed to provide you with an opportunity to:apply your understanding of SHRM models or frameworksevaluate the practical relevance of the models or frameworksconsider ethical implications of HRM interventionsPurposeFor the first assessment task, you are required to critically analyse and evaluate two theoretical models or frameworks for Strategic Human Resource Management. You are expected to assess the two theoretical models or frameworks by summarising, evaluating, and judging the credibility of the models or frameworks to Strategic Human Resource issues and practices.You will use material from the seminars, literature, or any of the sources such as the webinars which can be obtained (for free) from: The Society for Human Resource Management, The Human Capital Institute, or Australia Human Resource Institute.The focus should be on critical evaluation of the two theoretical models or frameworks and an overview of any related ethical issues.Tasks (1,000 words for the report)Select two theoretical models or frameworks from those we have discussed in the seminars or those you have researched yourselfCritically analyse and evaluate the practical application and credibility of the two theoretical models or frameworks to Strategic Human Resource issues and practices by;summarising the models or frameworks,critically evaluating their applicability, andjudging their application to SHRM issues and practicescommenting on any ethical implicationsThe assignment is to be submitted as followsThe font will be 12 pt Times New Roman.Line spacing will be 1 ½ (1.5).Word count and limit (1000 words +/- 10%)Paragraphs will have first sentence indentation.The report should havean executive summary,body of the reportappendicesa minimum of 10 referencesAppendices may be used as supporting material.

As the world becomes increasingly global and competitive, the future of work is changing from national focus to international focus. When a vacant position is advertised, it is very common to compete for the position with candidates all around the world. Therefore, being strategic and competitive in managing your career is imperative.This assessment will give students the opportunity to reflect on their career and develop an understanding of their overall career direction including their career goals, values, interests and preferences.PurposeThe aim of assessment task 2 is to enable students to build on their knowledge and skills of SHRM theories and processes about career management and employability through a reflection approach. Students will have the opportunity to reflect on their strengths and areas for development as it relates to their career goals. This assessment will also help students to understand the connections between theory and practice and develop practical skills in developing and managing one's career in a competitive and global world.TasksYou will produce a 1,000 word business report with at least 10 academic peer-reviewed sources. Your report will address the following:Self-assessments: clarifying your values, work-style personality and lifestyle-trade off and identifying your strengths and areas for development.Creating career plan and goals to enhance career-related experiences before and after graduationIntegration: consider the relationship between your self-assessment findings and your career plan and goals. How do your strengths and preferences align with your career goals and values? What knowledge and skills do you need to develop to help you to effectively pursue your career goals?Appendices: the appendices are included in the report but will not be part of the word count. The appendices include evidence from your self-assessments (e.g. values, work-style personality).

            "task_description": "Assessment 3: Report on current issues in SHRM in organisationsRationaleThis assessment continues the process of strategic HRM interventions and decision making and the use and application of the models from assessment 1.The main difference between assessment task 1 and assessment task 3 is that, whereas students were asked to evaluate SHRM models or frameworks in assessment 1, students will have the opportunity to identify and select a contemporary organisation in Australia or overseas for assessment 3 to apply their SHRM models or frameworks to issues affecting their chosen organisation. Students are expected to critically analyse the SHRM issues facing their chosen organisation and write a business report with solutions and recommendations that constructively address the issues in their chosen organisation.Note: Students may choose different SHRM models or frameworks or any other appropriate frameworks from the general business literature that are relevant and necessary to address the issues in the student's chosen organisation.Working as an HRM advisor, you are to present your solutions and recommendations in a business report. The report will be submitted on blackboard.PurposeThe aim of assessment task 3 is to enable students to build on their knowledge and skills of SHRM theories and processes through a case study method. Students will also understand the connections between theory and practice and develop practical skills in analysing, designing, implementing and evaluating SHRM processes and practices.TasksYou will produce a 2,000 word business report with at least 10 academic peer-reviewed sources. Your report will address the following:Decide on a medium to large organisations where there is a SHRM challenge/issue (e.g. recruitment, learning and development, performance management, talent management, etc). Also, it is NOT necessary to contact the organisation for interviews or visits. Students should rely only on secondary research including but not limited to company websites, strategic plans, annual reports, industry and analysts' reports.Based on the contents of MGTS7603 learning activities, you will determine the major SHRM challenges/issues (e.g. recruitment, learning and development, performance management, talent management, etc) the organisation is facing and why it is important to study and resolve this issue in the organisation.Provide an analysis of the internal and external environments of the organisations and background of the SHRM issues (e.g. historical, contextual or technological) in the organisation using appropriate analytical tools such as SWOT, PESTLE, Porter's Five-forces, etc.Conduct a review of the literature on the SHRM issue and identify major schools of thought about the SHRM issues, theories/models that best explain the SHRM issues and appropriate interventions to address the issues. Preferably, it is important to begin with the theories and models discussed in the course. However, you are NOT limited to the theories and models discussed in the course.Critically examine the SHRM issues in your case organisation using theories and models from the course as well as your literature review materials.Suggest at least two alternative ways (options) to manage the SHRM challenge/issues in your chosen organisation.Provide evidence of clear and concise articulation of the connection between SHRM theories/models and practice.Develop and present a clear set of recommendations to the executive director, CEO or Human Resource Manager of your case organisation on how to implement your proposed recommendations.Identify two key lessons you learned in writing and reporting on SHRM issues using a case study method.The assignment is to be submitted as followsThe font will be 12 pt Times New Roman.Line spacing will be 1 ½ (1.5).Word count and limit (2,000 words +/- 10%)Paragraphs will have first sentence indentation.The report should havean executive summary,body of the reportappendicesa minimum of 10 referencesAppendices may be used as supporting material.
