As the world becomes increasingly global and competitive, the future of work is changing from national focus to international focus. When a vacant position is advertised, it is very common to compete for the position with candidates all around the world.

Students will have the opportunity to reflect on their strengths and areas for development as it relates to their career goals. This assessment will also help students to understand the connections between theory and practice and develop practical skills in developing and managing one's career in a competitive and global world.</p>\n<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>\n<p>You will produce a 1,000 word business report with at least 10 academic peer-reviewed sources.

Preferably, it is important to begin with the theories and models discussed in the course. However, you are NOT limited to the theories and models discussed in the course. </li>\n<li>Critically examine the SHRM issues in your case organisation using theories and models from the course as well as your literature review materials.</li>\n<li>Suggest at least two alternative ways (options) to manage the SHRM challenge/issues in your chosen organisation.</li>\n<li>Provide evidence of clear and concise articulation of the connection between SHRM theories/models and practice.</li>\n<li>Develop and present a clear set of recommendations to the executive director, CEO or Human Resource Manager of your case organisation on how to implement your proposed recommendations.</li>\n<li>Identify two key lessons you learned in writing and reporting on SHRM issues using a case study method.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The assignment is to be submitted as follows</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The font will be 12 pt Times New Roman.</li>\n<li>Line spacing will be 1 ½ (1.5).</li>\n<li>Word count and limit (2,000 words +/- 10%)</li>\n<li>Paragraphs will have first sentence indentation.</li>\n<li>The report should have</li>\n<li>an executive summary,</li>\n<li>body of the report</li>\n<li>appendices</li>\n<li>a minimum of 10 references</li>\n<li>Appendices may be used as supporting material.
