The aim is to examine how the organisation uses marketing metrics to assess performance and to identify opportunities to enhance these metrics for better insight and alignment with organisational goals. The 10 minute presentation will be pitched to the CEO of the organisation, followed by 5 minutes Q&amp;A.</p>\n<p>In your presentation, you will evaluate the marketing metrics currently used by the organisation, explore how these metrics link to broader corporate performance metrics, and recommend additional or alternative marketing metrics that could provide greater insight or a more accurate measurement of marketing effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Your presentation should include the following components:</p>\n<p>1. Market Sector Overview</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contextualise the Market Sector: Provide a brief overview of the chosen market sector, key characteristics, and competitive dynamics that influence marketing measurement practices.</li>\n<li>Organisational Background: Introduce the specific organisation within this sector, including a summary of its goals, positioning, and key competitive advantages or challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2. Current Marketing Metrics Analysis</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify Key Marketing Metrics: Describe the primary marketing metrics the organisation currently uses. Metrics may include customer acquisition cost (CAC), customer lifetime value (CLV), brand awareness, engagement rates, conversion rates, etc.</li>\n<li>Evaluate Metric Effectiveness: Assess how these metrics help the organisation measure marketing outcomes and support its strategic objectives. Discuss any limitations or areas where the metrics may not fully capture marketing performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3. Linking Marketing Metrics to Corporate Performance</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alignment with Corporate Metrics: Analyse how the identified marketing metrics relate to broader corporate performance metrics, such as revenue growth, profitability, or market share. Explain whether these links support strategic objectives and drive decision-making.</li>\n<li>Assessment of Alignment: Evaluate whether the current metrics provide sufficient alignment with corporate goals, and identify any gaps where marketing metrics may not fully support the company’s overall performance metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4. Recommendations for Improved Marketing Metrics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify Additional/Alternative Metrics: Based on your analysis, recommend additional or alternative marketing metrics that could provide more valuable insight or better alignment with corporate objectives. Examples might include net promoter score (NPS), return on marketing investment (ROMI), customer satisfaction, or engagement through specific channels.</li>\n<li>Justify Your Recommendations: Explain how each recommended metric would enhance the organisation’s ability to measure, understand, and improve its marketing effectiveness in a way that aligns with corporate performance goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Teams can self-organise in any way that works for them. It is recommended that the project team works as a cross-functional team with different members fulfilling different functions (e.g., background research, analytics, design, presenting results), and that only 1-2 team members actually present the results of the analysis with other team members handling the Q&amp;A session. All team members must be present in-class or online for the presentation.</p>\n<p>Group members are expected to contribute equally, fulfilling the tasks agreed on. If there are disagreements in relation to team members' contributions that cannot be resolved, students must bring the problem to the attention of their Course Coordinator as early as possible. Students can elect to undertake a Peer Review process, which can influence the marks of those who do not contribute to group work.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy. </p>\n<p><strong>Assessment Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>·     Presentation Length: 10 minutes with 5 minute Q&amp;A</p>\n<p>·     Visuals: Prepare a clear, visually engaging marketing dashboard that displays key metrics, links to corporate performance, and proposed new metrics.</p>\n<p>·     References: Use credible sources, including academic literature and industry reports, to support your analysis and recommendations.</p>\n<p>·     Evaluation Criteria: Your presentation will be assessed on clarity of analysis, depth of insight, relevance of recommendations, and effectiveness of your visual dashboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
