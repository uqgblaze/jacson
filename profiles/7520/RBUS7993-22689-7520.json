To that end, unless otherwise instructed by the supervisor, the empirical honours thesis will have a minimum chapter content likely to include:IntroductionLiterature reviewModel and hypothesesMethodology of data collectionAnalysis, results, and discussionConclusion.The above structure is an example for an empirical thesis. In cases where a theoretical theses is undertaken a different structure would be required. Students are advised to seek direction of their supervisor on the appropriate structure in such cases.EthicsIt is the responsibility of all research students to ensure research undertaken is ethically sound. Ethics approval must be sought prior to any form of primary data collection. For more information on research ethics process, please see below links:All research involving humans that is not greater thanlow or negligible riskcan be reviewed by one our Faculty-based ethics sub-committees. Please direct all questions regarding low or negligible risk process tobellnr@uq.edu.au.Research involving humans that is greater than low or negligible risk will be reviewed by one of UQ’sHuman Research Ethics Committeein a full committee meeting.Please liaise with your UQ Business School academic supervisor for assistance with ethics application process.https://www.uq.edu.au/research/research-support/ethics-integrity-and-compliance/human-ethics/ethics-applicationThe ethics committee meet fortnightly to assess ethics applications. The cut-off date for submissions is one week prior to each scheduled meeting.If you require ethics approval as part of your research project, please upload evidence upon receipt of approval. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to info@business.uq.edu.au.Thesis Format and Word CountThe length of the thesis, inclusive of tables and figures but excluding cover page, acknowledgements, disclaimer, references and appendices, should not exceed 20,000 words or 100 pages of double-spaced printing in 12-point Times New Roman font on A4 paper. Please note that any content beyond this limit will not be considered for grading. To allow adequate room for binding and trimming, it is important to note that left and right-hand margins should be no less than 25mm, and top and bottom margins no less than 25mm.The fly page must show the following (template available on Blackboard)The University of QueenslandFaculty of Business, Economics & LawUQ Business School(the title)A thesis submitted to the Business School, The University of Queensland, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Business, Master of Commerce, Master of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Master of Tourism, Hotel and Event Management, Master of Global Management or Graduate Diploma in Research Methods (whichever applies).by (student's name)the dateSupervisor: (name)On a separate page show: Acknowledgements, which must include a signed disclaimer statement which says:“The work presented in this thesis is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, original, except as acknowledged in the text.

The report will be subject to plagiarism checks through Turnitin.UQ Business School research students are obligated to submit all research data through the UQ Research Data Manager (UQRDM). Instructions on how to upload your data is available via the attached document. Should you have issues in uploading the data, please contact the team vialibrary@uq.edu.auStudents who submit a research thesis are required to submit their final thesis for upload to UQ eSpace (this will be done by the school on your behalf). This repository aims to create global visibility and accessibility of UQ's scholarly research. You will have the opportunity to revise your thesis after submission for upload to UQ eSpace.The course administrator will be in contact with you after release of final grades to provide an opportunity to revise your thesis. For any student that does not submit a revised thesis, the School will revert to your original thesis on file (unless an alternative arrangement has been approved by the School).This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
