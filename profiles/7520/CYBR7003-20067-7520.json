Students can select one of these three topics. Alternatively, students can propose a topic, which must be approved by teaching staff.The word limit for the essay is a maximum of 2,200 words.By way of clarification, this word count:includes headings and subheadings;does not include text in the header;does not include footnotes or Appendices - however footnotes should be used for citation purposes only.  Substantive text should not be included in footnotes.This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.AI Statement:The use of AI is permitted for this assessment; however, it must comply with the guidelines and constraints outlined on Blackboard at the start of the course. These requirements include providing a record of the prompts used to query AI, the AI-generated responses, and evidence of critical analysis of the AI-generated text before incorporating it into the assessment. Typically, this information should be included in the assessment appendix. Additionally, any use of AI must be appropriately referenced within the submission. These measures are in place to ensure that students demonstrate a thorough understanding of their written work, independent of AI assistance, as this is a key requirement for passing the assessment.A failure to use AI according to the guidelines above (and detailed on Blackboard at the beginning of the course) may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
