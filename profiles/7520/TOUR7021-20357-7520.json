This task requires you to reflect upon your own service experiences on a daily basis, from a customer perspective, and then critically analyse one of these experiences through the lens of a relevant service management principle.This will be a 3-minute individual presentation delivered live during our class. It should provide sufficient description of a service experience that you have recently experienced. One photo taken by you is required to help explain the service experience to the rest of the students. This will be shared on the screen during your pitch.Your pitch should cover three vital aspects:Date, time and place of the service experience.A brief description of the service experience (so that the audience can understand enough to know if the link to the service concept is appropriate).A justification of the relevance between the experience and the assigned service management concept. These topics will be allocated in class. (eg. every student will be given a concept on which to base their presentation).There is no written component, but you must submit your Photo to Turnitin.AI STATEMENTThis assessment task is to be completed in-person. The use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT) tools will not be permitted.

This assignment requires you to reflect upon your own service experiences on a daily basis, from a customer perspective, and then critically analyse one of these experiences through the lens of a relevant service management principle. The service management principles that can be used will be discussed in class and include: Service Characteristics, Service Quality and Dual Value Creation.Students will share their individual service experience (from Assignment 1) through a 2000 word Report, including an Executive Summary, Service Experience Overview, Literature Review and Recommendations. This should provide sufficient description of a service experience that you have recently experienced. However, the main emphasis should be on the clear connection between ‘what happened’ and a relevant service principle. Using the principle, you should critically analyse the experience, and depending on the context, offer insights, draw a conclusion and/or offer recommendations. Develop this Report with industry (managers / leaders) being your target audience who should learn/benefit from your insights.The main emphasis is on your ability to apply service management principles in a real life context.AI STATEMENTArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task..
