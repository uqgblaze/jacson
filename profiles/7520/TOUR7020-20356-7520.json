Your topic cannot be related to service management, and it cannot be a case study. Research topics will be allocated in class early in the semester.Use your database searching skills (taught in class) to find three (3) or more academic journal articles published after 2014 that identify positive and/or negative impacts related to your research question. By using a range of articles you should be able to identify positive and negative impacts. If you only find positive or negative impacts then you will need to justify why this is the case.Use paraphrasing to summarise appropriate positive and negative impacts.Use APA7 referencing to identify the source(s) for each impact.Note:Your research will ONLY be based on an analysis of available literature in the field - you will NOT be collecting primary data (doing 'empirical' research).Format:Font size 11 pointFont type - Calibri; Times New Roman; ArialLine spacing - 1.5 spacingUse of AI/MT TechnologiesArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Your team is the group of students you were assigned to work with in class.As agroup:Prepare a report for the manager of your T/H/E business. Your report will be based on a tourism system developed for one (1) potential, or existing, target market for your T/H/E business. This is the system your group has been working on in class from Week 9 onwards.Include the following in your report:Title pageExecutive summary (overview of your whole report)Table of contents (use numbered headings)Introduction (explain why systems thinking is beneficial for your T/H/E business)'Body' of your report (Do not use the heading 'body'. Use headings appropriate for your topic). In this section include:Diagram of your systemExplanation of your systemRelevance of sustainability for your systemConclusion (summary of the key take-away points for your T/H/E business manager)Recommendations (analyse the underlying factors identified from each group member'sImpact Analysis(Assessment Task 2) to determine, and justify, three (3) strategies that your T/H/E business manager could implement to support/ encourage a sustainable system. Each recommendation should be approximately 200 words.).Reference list (at least 10 academic references published after 2014. These can include the sources used for yourImpact IdentificationandImpact Analysis)Appendices (if needed)Note: Your research will ONLY be based on an analysis of available literature in the field - you will NOT be collecting primary data (doing 'empirical' research). This means you can NOT contact your T/H/E business.Use of AI/MT technologies:This task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Machine Translation (MT) technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance.A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI and MT tools.Referencing: APA7Formatting:Font size - 11 pointFont type - Calibri; Times New Roman; ArialLine spacing - 1.5 spacingIndividual:Peer ReviewEach member of the group will complete a peer review of each group member's contribution to the development and writing of the report. This will be completed on Buddy Check and it will be due three (3) hours after the submission date/time of theSystem Report.No marks are awarded for the Peer Review however, no marks will be awarded for the group's report until all peer reviews are completed and submitted by the group.Oral DefenseDuring the end of semester exam block each group member will be required to do an individual Oral Defense question and answer (Q&A) to demonstrate their understanding of their group's System Report. In this five (5) minute session each student will be required to provide a verbal response to a series of randomly allocated questions. The questions are designed to determine if the individual's understanding of the development of the report and its content is consistent with the standard of the report.No marks are awarded for the Oral Defense however, if the individual is unable to demonstrate a level of knowledge consistent with the mark awarded for the report then that individual's mark will be scaled down accordingly.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
