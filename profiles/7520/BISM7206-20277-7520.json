Students are reminded that a key Learning Objective of this course is the ability to work in teams, and this assessment task directly addresses that Learning Objective. Accordingly, students are required to work in teams unless prior, special arrangements are in place with the course coordinator. Zero marks will apply if this requirement is not addressed.</p>\n<p><strong>Peer assessment:</strong> </p>\n<p>Students must submit confidential self and peer evaluations to enable assessment of team member contributions. The evaluation process assists the teaching team to understand how each student contributed and the findings are confidential.
