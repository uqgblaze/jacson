This group project offers an exciting opportunity to collaboratively develop a comprehensive advertising campaign in response to a client brief. Each team will formally prepare a presentation, referred to as the \"Pitch,\" to showcase their advertising project findings. Insights from individual <strong>Consumer Insight Analysis Reports</strong> can be incorporated into this group project.</p>\n<h3>Key Requirements:</h3>\n<h4><strong>Group Formation and Presentations</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Team Size</strong>: Groups will comprise five (5) students.</li>\n<li><strong>Presentation Schedule</strong>: Pitches will be delivered during tutorials in <strong>Week 12</strong> and <strong>Week 13</strong>, with scheduling managed by your tutor in a prior class.</li>\n<li><strong>Submission Deadline</strong>: The Pitch presentation document is due on the official <strong>DUE DATE</strong>, irrespective of the scheduled presentation week.</li>\n<li><strong>Duration</strong>: Presentations will be restricted to 15 minutes per team, followed by a 5-minute Q&amp;A session.</li>\n<li><strong>Professional Standards</strong>: Presentations must meet a professional standard, suitable for delivery to the client. All group members must speak during the presentation, though the time allocation for each member may vary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Assessment Resources</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guidelines and Criteria</strong>: Detailed assessment guidelines and the marking criteria sheet will be available on Blackboard. These will also be discussed in online lectures and workshops.</li>\n<li><strong>Language Requirement</strong>: The Pitch presentation must be delivered and submitted in English.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Self and Peer Review Process</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>Expectations of Team Members</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Group members are expected to contribute equally and fulfil the tasks agreed upon at the start of the semester.</li>\n<li>Clear communication and proactive engagement are essential. Poor communication is often the source of discrepancies and conflicts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Resolving Issues</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If disagreements about contributions arise and cannot be resolved within the group, the issue must be raised with the Lecturer, Course Coordinator, or Teaching Facilitator as early as possible.</li>\n<li>Late-enrolling students or those who do not engage with their group early may be required to complete the task individually or in a smaller team formed from remaining students.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Self and Peer Review Evaluation</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A Self and Peer Review Evaluation will be required, allowing team members to reflect on their own and others’ contributions.</li>\n<li>The <strong>team project grade</strong> will be derived from these evaluations, and the Course Coordinator reserves the right to adjust grades to ensure fairness.</li>\n<li>Students working in good faith will not experience grade adjustments, while individuals performing below expectations may face a negative grade adjustment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Additional Guidance:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be Proactive</strong>: Set clear expectations and establish effective communication early in the semester to minimise conflicts.</li>\n<li><strong>Raise Concerns Early</strong>: Address any team issues well before the submission deadline to avoid last-minute complications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For full details, refer to the assessment guidelines on Blackboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>This assessment task evaluates student’s abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
