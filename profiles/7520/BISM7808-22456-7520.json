The recommendations aim to make the organisation more 'future ready' than it currently is.  The enterprise may be any existing real-world enterprise. In practice, this might be the student's past or current employer, or perhaps a prospective future employer.  The briefing presents specific and focussed recommendations (between 4 and 6 recommendations) that are actionable by the Board.
