Larger service firms generally have established service processes with frequent service quality controls and you may not find any issues to study and report!The owner/managers must be willing to be interviewed by you. Normally smaller service firms would like external help to understand their issues and recommendations for service enhancement. You may promise them to provide your completed/assessed report or recommendations.If you have any doubt about the firm you have selected, talk to the course coordinator early in the semester.OVERVIEWYou are required to complete a written report that illustrates how the key concepts/frameworks from the course are applied to focal service firm.The purpose of this report is two-fold:First, it allows you to apply various concepts introduced during the semester.Second, it allows you to acquire a deeper understanding of one particular service firm and the industry in which it operates (hopefully one you are interested in and/or hope to work in).Content of the ReportThe following eight sections (listed below) are to help you demonstrate yourunderstanding of the conceptsfrom class andability to apply them to the chosen service firm.
