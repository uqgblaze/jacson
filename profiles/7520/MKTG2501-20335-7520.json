The written case study will include primary research evidence such as quotes from interviewed consumers, as well as secondary evidence from marketing and consumer journals, and industry reports to support analysis of the problem.The case study assessment hasTWOcomponents:Case study topic and research plan(10%). The purpose of the planning document is to demonstrate how information and data will be gathered to inform the written consumer behaviour case study. The planning document will include: details of the secondary data search strategy and preliminary summary of important academic and industry/news references, a research mind map, primary research data collection details including sampling information and a draft interview guide. Students will be expected to complete 3 consumer interviews to inform their case study analysis.The maximum work for the case study planning document is 2000 words (not including headings, in-text citations and the reference list)Case study presentation(20%). The problem-based case study findings will be presented by the team during tutorials in Weeks 12 & 13. The team should aim to present an interesting, evidenced based presentation about their case study findings. Key points to highlight during the presentation include: problem background and statement, presentation of research (primary consumer research and secondary background research), analysis of the problem applying appropriate consumer behaviour theory and concepts, and consumer marketing recommendations marketing and advertising industry, and business more widely. All team members must present on the day. The presentation will be 20 minutes (15 minute case presentation and 5 minutes for questions). On the day of the presentation, teams will upload their (a) presentation slides, (b) case study research portfolio including (interview sampling strategy, interview guide, interview analysis informed by consumer behaviour theory used in this course).Individual presentation(10%) Team members participation and contribution to the case study findings will be assessed individually based on consumer behaviour and research knowledge, presentation skills (confident, engaging and working effectively as a team member) and capacity to answer questions.Research:Students are expected to use academic and industry/news references. At a minimum, students need to include key theory and models discussed in tutorials and learning resources and synthesise academic and industry secondary research to obtain a passing grade.Teamwork:Teams will be formed during Week 2 tutorials and must be finalised in Week 3. Students can only form teams with members of their own tutorial group with a maximum of FIVE students per team. Students who enrol late or do not engage with their team early in the course may be required to complete the task as an individual, or in a smaller team that may be formed of remaining students.Teamwork is a valuable and important component of this university program. Students should be aware that in normal circumstances, all members of the team will receive the same mark for the case study, unless individual group issues are proactively identified prior to deadlines to enable resolutions.A team contract will be submitted during Week 4. Further, peer evaluation will be undertaken by all teams and will be considered in conjunction with the team contract and group records. Group contributions should be monitored weekly and proactive issues management should be implemented. Often issues are managed through clear communications and can be resolved for positive team outcomes and as such,all group issues should be flagged immediately with your tutor. It is essential that teams attempt to resolve issues during the case study project. However, individuals who are shown to not perform and do not contribute to the group will be penalized, having marks deducted to a standard which reflects the evidence, which may include receiving zero marks where warranted. In such situations, all individuals are responsible for keeping evidence of their contributions to the group.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.AI Statement:Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance. A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
