To that end, unless otherwise instructed by the supervisor, the empirical honours thesis will have a minimum chapter content likely to include:IntroductionLiterature reviewModel and hypothesesMethodology of data collectionAnalysis, results and discussionConclusion.The above structure is an example for an empirical thesis. In cases where a theoretical thesis is undertaken, a different structure would be required. Students are advised to seek direction of their supervisor on the appropriate structure in such cases.EthicsEthics approval must be sought prior to any form of primary data collection. Information regarding the ethics application process is as follows:Information about how to submit an application is available here:http://www.uq.edu.au/research/integrity-compliance/low-and-negligible-risk-reviewsAll applications should use the HREA form.http://www.uq.edu.au/research/integrity-compliance/hreaThe first committee meeting was held on 31/01, with fortnightly meetings scheduled thereafter. The cut-off date for submissions is one week prior to each scheduled meeting. The schedule for future meetings (and cut-off dates) is available here:http://www.uq.edu.au/research/integrity-compliance/files/human/2017%20BEL%20LNR.xlsxAny questions regarding the ethics process should be directed to:BELLNR@UQ.EDU.AUThesis Format and Word CountThe length of the thesis, inclusive of tables and figures but excluding references and appendices, shouldnot exceed 20,000 words.Please note that any content beyond this limit will not be considered for grading.
