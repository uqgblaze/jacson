You are expected to \"attend\" the research workshops during the semester and demonstrate an appreciation of the merit of the workshop papers from a scientific method perspective. This mastery will be demonstrated by preparing a series of critiques of selected workshop papers presented during the semester.The workshop schedule will be distributed as soon as it becomes available and updated on a regular basis.Please note, the schedule is always \"flexible\" and last minute changes are possible.You are required to complete an independent \"referee's report\" (approximately1,500 words) on 5 workshop papers that you nominate from the workshop program; at least one report relating to an accounting paper and one to a finance paper - the remaining three reports can be either accounting or finance (students whose major is neither accounting nor finance will alternatively consider workshop papers from within their own discipline).The workshop schedule will be distributed as soon as it becomes available andupdated on a regular basis. The eligible workshops will be identified in advance (not all workshops will necessarily be deemed \"eligible\" for critique).Again, please note, the schedule is always \"flexible\" and last minute changes are possible. You are, therefore, well advised to identify the workshop papers that interest you the most in advance, and also to have a contingency plan in mind if one of those papers is withdrawn.Finally, while students are strongly encouraged to discuss issues that arise in this course together, the written work you submit must be entirely your own. Similarly, you must not help another student to cheat by lending assignments (present or past). The submission of work or ideas which are not your own and for which you claim credit is called plagiarism. This is a form of cheating.AI Statement:This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
