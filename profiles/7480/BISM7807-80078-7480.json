            "task_description": "In the first seminar, teams will be allocated to work together throughout the course.The participants of each team will work together on a case study to identify the operational issues, and formulate a strategy for moving forward.The overall objective of the case study is to prepare a 1,500 word board report on the operations of the case assigned to the team.The team will present their solutions to the class. A total of 30 minutes will be allocated for each presentation including a class discussion. Teams should allocate 10 to 15 minutes within the time allocated for discussion with the lecturer and class. The presentation schedule will be communicated at the first seminar.The team will then write up the Case Study Report, incorporating feedback from the presentation. The style of the report should be as if being submitted to the Board of Directors of the Case Study entity.The study must concentrate on the operational aspects of the operation considered. While there may be marketing, organisational or strategic issues involved, for example, it would not be appropriate to devote all the analysis to development of marketing plans, organisational proposals or strategic plans. The aim of the exercise is not only to demonstrate an understanding of how the operation supports or hinders the attainment of the organisation's objectives but more importantly to identify any outstanding operational problems and make recommendations for improvement.The final report should include the following:an Executive Summary;a brief description of the business or organisational objectives and context including its method of obtaining competitive advantage;an analysis of the operational issues and challenges involved;identification of the problems involved, including problems already dealt with;identification of any outstanding problems;recommendations and implementation plans to address these problems.As a team assessment item, it is important team members have the opportunity to provide a peer evaluation with this assessment. Team members will be given the opportunity to provide feedback on the contributions made by other team members. Consequently, an individual team member's assessment may increase or decrease as a result of the evaluation of their contribution to the team by their peers. Further details will be provided in the class by the Course Coordinator during Seminar One.Further details will be provided in the case study briefing available in Seminar One.AI StatementArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI and/or MT in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of AI or MT in each instance.A failure to reference generative AI or MT use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
