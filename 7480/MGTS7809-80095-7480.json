The aim of this part of the assessment is for you to apply the models and ideas covered in the course and show a critical analysis and evaluation of the context in the case.It is recommended that you start working with your team on the presentation as soon as possible. You will need to work beyond the lecture material, use the provided readings, and conduct further research. You may want to carry out industry specific research to fully understand the context with the case and how it relates to the relevant Australian business context. With your solution, you need to consider potential sustainability considerations of your proposed plans.You need to demonstrate that you can draw on and apply relevant theories and evidence from both the academic and practitioner literature where appropriate. You must demonstrate your awareness of at least two theories or models associated with SHRM. You may, of course, use more (and also relevant practitioner material).You are expected to design an interesting yet concise presentation that identifies a proposed strategy and present this in a compelling way that persuades stakeholders to a course of action.NotesIt is likely that much of your team communication will be conducted via Zoom as not all members may be able to come into the CBD. Please ensure all members are included. If any of your team members fail to respond, you should contact your course coordinator.Each student is expected to contribute equally throughout the group assessment and presentation. An additional peer review assessment (Part B) will be completed to consider the contribution of each of the team members. This will provide additional information for the assessment of the group project and if it is deemed that a student fails to contribute to a substantial degree, as assessed by their group peers, their result may be amended to reflect this.Presentation quality relates to demonstration of verbal communication skills: rate, rhythm, articulation, pauses, pitch, tone, volume; demonstration of non-verbal communication skills: body language (facial expressions, gestures, posture), eye contact, professionalism; demonstration of competency with IT/visual support; time management; clear structure and flow, consistency in layout; proofreading; conforming with reference guide.Criteria and MarkingA rubric for this assessment is available on Blackboard, but in summary the criteria for this assessment are:Case Content - Depth of Knowledge and Understanding ShownCritical Analysis - Quality of Critical Analysis of Relevant Aspects of the CaseIdentify, Define and Account of the InitiativeConsideration of the Sustainability of the InitiativePresentation Quality - Quality of the Design and Delivery of the PresentationApproaches to AIThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Please Note:The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ Policy.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",

It is important to remember that successful implementation of SHRM practices does not necessarily involve a big budget and large project teams, nor do they always require the introduction of a major SHRM system to solve the problem. Research highlights that contemporary SHRM practices can be implemented in relatively small ways, resulting in huge shifts in many firms.The purpose of this report is to conduct an in-depth analysis of a SHRM issue in an organisation. The SHRM issue needs to be addressed using contemporary HR management theory and practice in order to recommend an initiative that can be introduced in a real-life organisation to solve a particular HR problem. Ideally, the scenario will be drawn from the student’s own experience and be based on HR activities in an organisation that they have worked in or are still currently employed. If required, there may also be a potential option for students with limited HR experience to discuss a potential case with the Course Coordinator.The emphasis of this report is on the SHRM issue and proposed solution; the problem is important for context but do not focus your document only on telling a story about the issue. Instead focus on the literature and integrating the course learnings to propose a meaningful solution based on research and contemporary practice in HR today.Remember that every single employee is impacted by the HR function, not just leaders that are partly responsible for HR related matters with their team. As a result, it is suggested you think about any relevant challenges your organisation has faced in terms of the various key HR practices.Students may select any topic or contemporary issue in SHRM (the SHRM initiative does not need to be a major programme as long as it can be considered a SHRM initiative). For example, students might identify a problem that is related to: HR Planning, Recruitment, Selection, Induction, Training and Development, Contracts, ER/IR, Reward and Remuneration, Performance Management and Appraisals, Employee Mentoring and Coaching, Employee Engagement and Talent Management, Employee Wellbeing and Mindfulness, Workplace Health and Safety, Career Development and Succession Planning, Termination and Redundancy, Employee Exit and Departure, etc.The issue that you select will preferably be based on your experiences. However, further academic research is required of both peer-reviewed articles as well as relevant industry reports in the field you choose.This task seeks to ensure that student use the SHRM literature along with the seminar content as a foundation for analysis of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the solution as best practice for the specific organisation optimising their human capital in the context of strategic aims.The executive summary must include three key components and be maximum one page: (1) Statement about the organisational challenge, i.e., what is the challenge the organisation is facing? (2) Statement about the initiative, i.e., what initiative is proposed for implementation to solve this organisational challenge? (3) Statement about the expected outcome, i.e., how will the initiative solve the challenge and how can the organisation measure it?NotesYou may wish to consider some of the following aspects in your analysis (these are meant to prompt ideas / be guidelines, and not reflect a comprehensive list of considerations):Description and Evaluation of SHRM Issue - overview of the issue / situation (be careful not to just tell a story or be overly descriptive here - focus on a concise, yet detailed overview of the issue to present a picture of the situation to the marker without wasting words):What is the history or background of this issue?How did the problem originate?How was the issue determined/discovered to be a problem?What challenges have become present from the issue in the organisation?What are the key features of this issue? What does the marker really need to know about the case to understand the scenario?Why is it important that this issue will be addressed in the organisation?What forces (if any) have maintained the status quo (e.g., resistance to change)? Explain if there is a deep embedment of the issue in organisational culture? What is required for significant change to occur?Recommendation and Proposed Solution - strategies moving forward:What are some major arguments in field of literature around this topic? What is the research suggesting organisations do to support this HR function in contemporary workplaces today?What is your overall proposed recommendation and solution to help improve the current or past state of play and shift the status quo?What can be done to successfully plan, manage, communicate, and implement a SHRM solution?If there has been any change already to the firm, has the change/initiative gone far enough as yet? Have all aspects of the issue been addressed? What else could be recommended at a strategic level to help offer a more effective solution in contemporary HR today?Are there any downstream effects? How could the organisation ensure that the initiative is successful long-term?GeneralStudents are welcome to discuss their proposed issue with the Course Coordinator.Consider this report as a briefing tool by an internal HR team (you, inside the case organisation) reporting to your executive team (me, the CEO of the case organisation)The report is for educational purposes only and will be treated by academic staff as confidential. All organisations can be de-identified or renamed if required.

As a reflective piece, you would want to consider your role in the practice or event and/or your response at the time. You would want to reflect on the obligations of the parties involved in the managerial practice or activity (including yourself) and consider appropriate behaviours or actions.You may wish to address whether and how you responded to or engaged in the practice or activity; how you intend to respond going forward and engage in action; how you and others were/would be impacted by a \"calling out\" of the unethical, biased, or questionable managerial human resource related practice. You would also want to consider whether or how the HR management related activity or practice links with the SHRM system or backdrop in the organisation. Your reflective essay must include a reflection on your self-assessment; commitment to action for change going forward; and a careful consideration of future behaviours or actions.You will want to consider some aspect of the course and lessons learnt from the SHRM content covered to reflect on the (HR related) managerial practice that you focus on (and/or how you might improve the practice/or suggest an improvement going forward).NotesTopics for reflection may include (but are not limited to):Engaging effectively with employees from different backgrounds and culturesDemonstrating inclusive behaviourAsking questions instead of making assumptionsCreating a bias-free cultureChallenging the fairness of or ethics of an HR (or HR related) practiceEnsuring fairness and ethical practiceHighlighting the unfair people outcomes that particular HR practice/practices may lead to and how this should be addressedStructure of ethical reflectionsReflective essays always have an introduction, where the speaker shares, either directly or indirectly, what the overall focus of the reflection will be. An academic reflective writer should be direct in explaining what aspect of their experiences they are focusing on.A key part of the body of the reflective essay explains how the writer has changed or what the writer has learned through the process of reflection; this can often involve in-depth introspection and / or a turn of the (critical) reflective lens onto the self. It also explains what things caused the writer to change. A strong reflective writer will not only share the change but also give examples as supporting details. For example, if a writer discusses becoming more ethical in life, then examples should be given of what made this change, such as sharing an incident in which the writer took a positive approach to resolving the incident.In the conclusion of a reflective essay, the writer summarises how they have changed or the effect of those changes. The writer also might look ahead and look backward. If looking ahead, the writer shares how they think the experiences in the course (and reflections from the content) will change them in the future. If/when looking backward, the writer will reflect on how different they were in the past. Often, the writer will compare past and future selves to emphasise the differences.Criteria and MarkingA rubric for this assessment is available on Blackboard, but in summary the criteria for this assessment are:Identify and Define the Ethical IssueAwareness of Personal Position on the Issue; Obligations, Responsibilities and/or DutyDepth of ReflectionEvidence of Self-Criticism, Introspection, Self-Insight, and Learning about Unconscious Biases, Stereotypes, Preconceptions, or Previous Assumptions or Value-based BeliefsCommitment to One ActionOverall Quality of ExpositionApproaches to AIThis task has been designed to be challenging, authentic and complex. Whilst students may use AI technologies, successful completion of assessment in this course will require students to critically engage in specific contexts and tasks for which artificial intelligence will provide only limited support and guidance. A failure to reference AI use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. To pass this assessment, students will be required to demonstrate detailed comprehension of their written submission independent of AI tools.Read full task descriptionHide full task description",
