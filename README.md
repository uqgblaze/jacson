# JacSON — Overview, Setup & Configuration Guide

Welcome to JacSON: a Javascript and JSON-based scraper and publishing tool for UQ Jac Course Profiles.  
This guide explains everything that must be edited if you're adapting JacSON for another school, faculty, or institution.

## Quick Links

- View code on Github: https://github.com/uqgblaze/jacson
- Live version: https://uqgblaze.github.io/jacson/

## Overview

JacSON automates the retrieval of learning outcomes, assessment details, and weekly learning activities from the current (non-archived) version of the UQ course profiles website. These outputs can then be used to pre-populate components in Blackboard Ultra using JavaScript, enabling a more efficient course build process for teaching teams and learning designers.

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Course Intelligence**: Parses and extracts structured data such as:
  - Learning Outcomes
  - Assessment Tasks (titles, weights, dates, descriptions)
  - Weekly Activities (topics, outcomes, periods)
- ⛔ **Smart Filtering**: Ignores any links to archived course profiles.
- 📝 **Google Sheets Enabled**: Reads course codes from a central **Google Sheet** and updates scrape status and notes for each course
- 🪵 **Creates logs and buffers**: Uses a local `course-list.csv` file to determine which courses to scrape or ignore.
- 🗃️ **Organized Output**: Saves JSON output in folders by semester code.
- ☁️ **Automatic Cloud Publishing**: Configured to automatically upload JSON results to GitHub repository
- 🧪 **Python-based and extensible**: Designed to be modular and easy to integrate with existing Python or web workflows.
- ✅ **Deploy and copy HTML to any course**: You can then copy and deploy the HTML to **any** course in Blackboard Ultra. It will automatically find the course code and find the scraped JSON file within a document.

## Limitations

- This tool is purpose-built for the **UQ JAC system** and may not generalize to other institutions without significant modification.
- Course profiles need to be written in a standardised format to benefit from this tool.
- The JSON file can only be called within a **document** on Blackboard. **This script does not work at the course-view level.**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Here’s how to replicate JacSON from scratch in your school or faculty.

### 1. Download Repo as ZIP file

If you haven't already, download the Repo as a ZIP file. Instructions below assume you've saved it to: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\JacSON`

### 2. 🐍 Install Python

Make sure Python 3.10 or later is installed.

- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- During install: ✅ *Add Python to PATH*

Once that is installed, open a command prompt window (CMD.exe, not PowerShell!) and change to the folder: e.g. `cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents\JacSON`

Then install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- If you get an error about 'pip', that means you need to manually install PIP. Google is your friend!

### 3\. 📄 Google Sheet Setup

- See link for template: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y4JfTa76oVyWndfA83bAqeN4XwjbMKyWgOyR60yEzXs/edit?usp=sharing

JacSON expects this layout:

| A (Course Code) | B (Auto) | C (Status) | D (Manual) | E | F (Notes) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ACCT7804 | TRUE |  |  |  |  |

-   Column B: `TRUE` to auto-run
-   Column C: Status (e.g., Scheduled, Success!, Failure)
-   Column D: If `TRUE`, the course is ignored


---

## Getting your SECRETS ready

### 4\. 🔐 Google Sheets Setup

JacSON reads and writes to a shared Google Sheet. To enable this:

#### a. Create a Service Account:

-   Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
-   Create a new project and enable the **Google Sheets API**
-   Generate a Service Account with a JSON key file
-   Share your Sheet with the service account email (e.g., `jacson-api@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)

#### b. Save the key file

Place your credentials JSON here:

`./secrets/credentials.json`

- **Currently unsupported feature**: For GitHub Actions, set as an environment variable `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.

### 🔐 How to Set Up a GitHub Personal Access Token

#### 🧱 Prerequisites

-   A GitHub account
-   Access to the target GitHub repository (owner or write access)
* * *

#### ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

##### **a\. Log in to GitHub**

Go to: [https://github.com/login](https://github.com/login)

* * *

##### **b\. Open Developer Settings**

-   Click your profile icon in the top-right
-   Select **"Settings"**
-   Scroll down the left sidebar to **"Developer settings"**
-   Click on **"Personal access tokens"**
-   Then click **"Tokens (classic)"**
* * *

##### **c\. Generate a New Token**

-   Click **"Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"**
* * *

##### **d\. Configure the Token**

Fill out the form:

-   **Note**: Something like `JacSON Uploader`
-   **Expiration**: Choose a long-lived token if you're automating
-   **Scopes**: ✅ Tick only:
    -   `repo` → full control of private repositories

This includes:

-   `repo:status`
-   `repo_deployment`
-   `public_repo`
-   `repo:invite`
* * *

##### **e\. Generate and Save the Token**

-   Click the green **"Generate token"** button
-   📋 **Copy and Save the token immediately** — GitHub will not show it again!
* * *

### 🔒 Using the Token in JacSON

1.  Open your JacSON folder.
2.  Create a file:

    `./secrets/github_token.txt`

3.  Paste the token into the file:

    `ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

✔️ Now JacSON’s `upload_profiles.py` will authenticate and upload `.json`

## 🛠 Manual Controls

-   To **test specific courses**: edit `course-list.csv` directly
-   To **run individual scripts**:
    -   Pull course list: `python scripts/generate_course_list.py`
    -   Scrape only: `python jacson.py`
    -   Upload only: `python scripts/upload_profiles.py`
    -   Update status:

---

## Automated Controls

- To run this automatically from your computer, run either option depending on your operating system:

## ✅ Option 1: **Windows** — Use Task Scheduler

### 🔧 Script File (Windows Batch Script)

Save this as `run_jacson.bat` in the same folder as your JacSON project:

`@echo off cd /d "C:\Path\To\Your\JacSON" python scraper_runner.py`

> 🔄 Replace `C:\Path\To\Your\JacSON` with your actual folder path.

* * *

### 📅 Setup in Task Scheduler

1.  Open **Task Scheduler**
2.  Click **Create Basic Task**
3.  Name it: `Run JacSON Scraper`
4.  Choose **Daily**
5.  Set your time (e.g., 9:00 PM)
6.  Action: **Start a program**
7.  Program/script: `C:\Path\To\Your\JacSON\run_jacson.bat`
8.  Finish ✅

* * *

## ✅ Option 2: **macOS / Linux** — Use Cron

### 🔧 Script File

Save this as `run_jacson.sh` and make it executable:

`#!/bin/bash cd /path/to/your/JacSON /usr/bin/python3 scraper_runner.py`

> Use `which python3` to confirm the Python path

Then make it executable:

`chmod +x run_jacson.sh`

* * *

### 📅 Setup Cron Job

1.  Open terminal
2.  Edit your crontab:

    `crontab -e`

3.  Add a line like this (for 9:00 PM daily):

    `0 21 * * * /path/to/your/JacSON/run_jacson.sh >> /path/to/your/JacSON/logs/cron.log 2>&1`

# 🔧 Editable Configuration Overview

Below is a complete list of files, variables, and settings that you will need to modify to get JacSON running in your own environment.

---

### 1. ✅ Google Sheets Configuration

**File:** `scripts/sheets_updater.py`  
**Lines:**
```python
SPREADSHEET_ID = '1tJ04EY1AtyS-7iKlmgZhmom0f97xK3DsZ88wkqmRwNs'
RANGE_NAME     = 'Sheet1!A2:F'
CREDENTIALS_FILE = os.path.join('secrets', 'credentials.json')
```

- 🔄 Replace `SPREADSHEET_ID` with your own Google Sheet ID (found in the URL).
- 🔄 Update `RANGE_NAME` if your data starts in a different cell.
- 📁 Ensure `credentials.json` exists at `./secrets/credentials.json`.

---

### 2. 🔐 Google Service Account Setup

**Files:**  
- `scripts/sheets_updater.py`  
- `scripts/update_status.py`  
- `scripts/generate_course_list.py`

These scripts expect a service account credential file saved to:
```bash
./secrets/credentials.json
```

---

### 3. ☁️ GitHub Repository Settings

**File:** `scripts/upload_profiles.py`  
**Lines:**
```python
